<h2>PART II</h2>

<h3>ESTHONIAN FOLK-TALES</h3>

<h4>(<i>continued</i>)</h4>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>SECTION III</h2>

<h3><i>COSMOPOLITAN STORIES</i></h3>


<p>Under this heading we propose to notice a series of tales which are
almost the common property of all nations, and the origin of which is
lost in remote antiquity. These we have arranged under their most
familiar names in alphabetical order.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>BLUEBEARD.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>

<p>The Esthonian version of "Bluebeard" (the Wife-Murderer) is very similar
to the usual story. A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> rich lord, reported to have vast treasure-vaults
under his castle, lost his wives very fast, and married, as his twelfth
wife, the youngest of the three daughters of a reduced gentleman in the
neighbourhood. An orphan boy had been brought up in the household, and
had served first as gooseherd, and then as page; but he was always known
as "Goose-Tony." He was nearly of the same age as the young lady, who
had been his playmate, and he declared that the rich suitor was a
murderer; his heart told him so, and his presentiments had never yet
deceived him. The boy was scolded and threatened, but his warnings made
so much impression that he was allowed to accompany the bride to her new
home.</p>

<p>Three weeks afterwards, the husband set out on a journey, leaving his
keys with his wife, among which was the gold key of the forbidden
chamber. He warned her that if she even looked in, he would be forced to
behead her with his own hand. She begged him in vain to take charge of
it himself; but he refused, and left it with her.</p>

<p>Next morning one of the lady's sisters came to stay with her; but a day
or two afterwards the page gave her another warning, after which he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
suddenly disappeared, and no trace of him could be found. The two
sisters looked over the house, and at last encouraged each other to
enter the secret chamber. In the middle stood an oaken block with a
broad axe upon it, and the floor was splashed with blood. In the
background against the wall stood a table, with the bloody heads of the
squire's former wives ranged upon it. The lady dropped the key in her
horror, and on picking it up found it covered with blood-stains, which
nothing could remove, while the door stood a handbreadth open, as if an
invisible wedge had fallen between the door and the door-post.</p>

<p>The squire was not expected to return for a week, but he came back next
morning, and rushed upstairs in a frenzied rage, dragged his wife to the
block by her hair, and was just lifting the axe, when he was struck down
by Goose-Tony with a heavy cudgel, and bound. He was brought to justice,
and sentenced to death, and his property was adjudged to his widow, who
shortly after married the page who had saved her life.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span></p>

<h2>CINDERELLA.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>The Esthonian story of Tuhka-Triinu (Ash-Katie<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>), as given by
Kreutzwald, is more on the lines of the German <i>Aschenputtel</i> than on
those of the French <i>Cendrillon</i>.</p>

<p>Once upon a time there lived a rich man with his wife and an only
daughter. When the mother dies, she directs her daughter to plant a tree
on her grave, where the birds can find food and shelter.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The father
marries a widow with two daughters, who ill-treat the motherless girl,
declaring that she shall be their slave-girl. A magpie cries from the
summit of the tree, "Poor child, poor child! why do you not go and
complain to the rowan-tree? Ask for counsel, when your hard life will be
lightened."</p>

<p>She goes to the grave at night, and a voice asks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span> her to whom she should
appeal, and in whom she should trust, and she answers, "God." Then the
voice tells her to call the cock and hen to help her, when she has work
to do which she cannot perform by herself.</p>

<p>When the king's ball is announced, Cinderella has to dress her sisters,
after which the eldest throws lentils into the ashes, telling her to
pick them up; but this is done by the cock and hen. She is left at home
weeping, and a voice tells her to go and shake the rowan-tree. When she
had done so, a light appeared in the darkness, and she saw a woman
sitting on the summit of the tree. She was an ell high, and clothed in
golden raiment, and she held a small basket and a gold wand in her
hands. She took a hen's egg from her basket, which she turned into a
coach; six mice formed the horses, a black beetle<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> formed the
coachman, and two speckled butterflies the footmen.</p>

<p>The little witch-maiden then dressed Tuhka Triinu as magnificently as a
Saxon lady. She then sent her to the ball, warning her to leave before
the cock crows for the third time, as everything will then resume its
original shape. On the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> night Tuhka Triinu took to flight, and
lost one of her little gold shoes, which the prince found next morning.
When it came to be tried on, Tuhka Triinu's sisters, who thought they
had small feet, tugged and squeezed without success. But the shoe fitted
Tuhka Triinu. Her guardian again robed her magnificently, and she
married the prince.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<h2>THE DRAGON-SLAYER.</h2>


<p>We find this story in a familiar form in that of "The Lucky Rouble"
(Kreutzwald). The father of three sons, before his death, gives
Peter,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> the youngest, a magic silver rouble, which always returns to
the pocket of its possessor. Peter afterwards meets a one-eyed old man,
who sells him three black dogs, named Run-for-Food, Tear-Down, and
Break-Iron. Afterwards, when passing through a forest, he meets a grand
coach, in which a princess, who has been chosen by lot to be delivered
over to a monster, is being conveyed to her doom. Peter abides the
issue, and encounters the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> monster, which is described as like a bear,
but much bigger than a horse, covered with scales instead of hair, with
two crooked horns on the head, two long wings, long boars' tusks, and
long legs and claws.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> With the assistance of the dog Tear-Down, Peter
kills the monster, cuts off his horns and tusks, and leaves the princess
with the coachman, promising to return in three years. The coachman
compels the princess by threats to say that he killed the dragon; but
the princess contrives to delay her marriage with the coachman, and on
the wedding-day Peter returns, is imprisoned by order of the king, but
released by Break-Iron. Then he sends Run-for-Food to the princess, who
recognises him, and reveals the secret to her father. The coachman is
condemned to death, and Peter produces the horns and claws of the
dragon, and marries the princess, when the dogs, whose mission is
accomplished, assume the forms of swans, and fly away.</p>

<h2>THE DWARF'S CHRISTENING.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>This story takes a very similar form in Esthonia to that familiar to us
nearer home. A young lady out walking with her maid encounters a snake,
which the maid wishes to destroy, but the lady remonstrates. A few days
afterwards, a little man enters her room and asks her to become
godmother to his child. She at last consents, and he promises to fetch
her at the right time, and informs her that he lives under the kitchen
steps in the subterranean kingdom.</p>

<p>Next Thursday evening, the dwarf leads her down a long flight of stairs
to a great house with many rooms, all lit up with tapers and full of
company. She was invited to take her seat at table, but on looking up,
she saw a sharp sword suspended over her head. She wanted to flee, but
the master ordered the sword to be removed, and the child's mother told
her that her own life lately hung on a hair, for she was the snake whose
life she had saved. When the young lady left, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span> master filled her
apron with earth, but she shook it out, whereupon he raked it up, and
pressed it on her again, saying, "Don't despise the least gift from a
grateful heart." In the morning, of course, it had turned to gold and
silver.</p>

<p>After this, the dwarf often visited the young lady, and at length asked
her to pour a jug of milk under the kitchen-stairs every morning. But
one day the wicked maid ordered a dishful of boiling milk to be poured
down very early. Presently the dwarf came weeping to the young lady,
saying that his child had been scalded to death by the hot milk. But he
knew who was to blame; let her put what she most valued together, and
leave the house at once. She did so, and on looking back, she saw the
whole house in flames, and in a few hours nothing remained of it and its
inhabitants but a heap of ashes. But the lady took another house,
married happily, and lived to see her children's children.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE ENVIOUS SISTERS.</h2>


<p>The Esthonian version of this story (the last in Galland's original
translation of the <i>Thousand</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span> <i>and One Nights</i>, and also found in Germany
and elsewhere), is peculiarly fantastic as "The Prince who rescued his
Brothers" (Kreutzwald). A young king was very ill, and the soothsayers
and magicians could not cure him. One of the magicians, however, at
length finding that the king's hands and arms were gold-coloured to the
elbows, his legs silver-coloured to the knees, and his belly of the
colour of blue glass, told him that he would only be cured by marrying a
young bride similarly coloured. Such a bride was discovered in the
daughter of one of the king's generals, and she was made queen. The
queen was confined of six boys at once; but her elder sister was jealous
of her, and availed herself of the services of an old witch, who carried
the children away by night, and handed them over to the Old Boy,
replacing them with puppies. The queen was confined a second and a third
time, each time of three princes, who suffered the same fate, but the
nurse contrived to hide one of the last three princes. Nevertheless, the
king was now so enraged that he ordered the mother and child to be
thrown into the sea on an iron bed for a boat. But it floated away with
them; and when the prince was seven weeks old, he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span> grown to be a
young man, and he began to talk to his mother. Soon afterwards they
reached an island, when the prince kicked the bed to pieces, and they
went ashore. The prince met an old man, who gave him a hatchet which
would build houses, and a wand which would change ants into men;
whereupon the prince built and populated a city. The prince then changed
himself into a flea, and went to his father's palace. The king had
married the wicked sister-in-law, and she was trying to persuade him not
to visit the island where the queen and prince had settled, but to visit
another country, where he would see more wonderful things. He went; but
his son had already removed the wonders to his own island, and he
returned disappointed. As the king was still bent on visiting the
island, the new queen advised him instead to visit a country where he
would see eleven men, coloured like himself. When the prince told his
mother what he had heard, she knew that they were her sons. Then the
queen prepared three cakes, one poisoned, and the others mixed with milk
from her breast. The prince set out, gave the poisoned cake to the old
devil who guarded his brothers, and divided the other cakes with them.
They then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> escaped to the prince's island in the form of doves, and
presently the king and queen arrived, and the king was informed of the
whole plot.</p>

<p>Then the king ordered the wicked queen and the sorceress to be put to
death, and settled down in his son's island with his wife and children.</p>

<h2>THE GIFTED BROTHERS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>This familiar story appears in the form of Swiftfoot, Quickhand, and
Sharpeye. It begins with the lamentation of a rich but childless wife,
who is consoled by a pretty little girl,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> who suddenly appeared, and
directed her to boil three eggs of a black hen for her husband's supper,
and then to send him to bed, but to walk in the open air herself before
retiring. In due course, three strong boys were born, and the fairy came
to see them in their cradles. She took a ball of red thread from her
pocket, and tied threads round the ankles of one boy, the wrists of
another, and the temples of the third. She directed the mother not to
disturb<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> the threads till the children were taken to the christening,
and then to burn the threads, collect the ashes in a spoon, and moisten
them with milk from her breast; and as soon as the children were brought
home from the christening, to give each two drops of the mixture on his
tongue. Of course one boy was gifted with great swiftness, and another
with great strength and skill in handiwork, and another with great
sharpness of sight.</p>

<p>When they grew up, the youths separated to seek their fortunes, agreeing
to meet at home in three years' time, and Swiftfoot went eastwards, and
entered into the service of a king as groom, and made himself famous in
that capacity.</p>

<p>Quickhand, who went southwards, could take up any trade without learning
it, and could turn out twenty coats or pairs of shoes in a day, better
made than the best tailor or shoemaker. He too made himself famous by
supplying a whole army with a full outfit at the shortest notice, when
all the workmen in the kingdom were unable to do so by the time
required.</p>

<p>The adventures of Sharpeye may be given more in detail.</p>

<p>Sharpeye, the third brother, set out westwards.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span> He wandered about for a
long time from one place to another without meeting with any profitable
employment. He could easily earn enough anywhere for his daily expenses
as a good shot, but what could he make in this way to bring home? At
length he reached a large city, where everybody was talking about a
misfortune which had befallen the king thrice already, but which no one
was able to comprehend or guard against. The king had a valuable tree in
his garden, which bore golden apples, many of which were as large as a
great ball of thread, and might have been worth many thousand roubles.
It may be imagined that such fruit was not left uncounted, and that
guards were stationed around night and day to prevent any attempt at
robbery. Nevertheless one of the largest apples, valued at six thousand
roubles, had been stolen every night for three nights running. The
guards had neither seen the thief nor been able to discover any trace of
him. It immediately occurred to Sharpeye that there must be some very
strange trick in the affair, which his piercing sight might perhaps
enable him to discover. He thought that if the thief did not approach
the tree incorporeally and invisibly, he would never be able<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> to escape
his sharp eyes. He therefore asked the king to allow him to visit the
garden to make his observations without the knowledge of the guards. On
receiving permission, he prepared himself a place of concealment in the
summit of a tree not far from the golden apple-tree, where no one could
see him, while his sharp eyes could pierce everywhere, and see
everything that happened. He took with him a bag of bread and a bottle
of milk, so that there would be no need for him to leave his
hiding-place. He now kept close watch on the golden apple-tree, and on
everything around it. The guards were posted round the tree in three
rows, so close that not a mouse could have crept between them
unobserved. The thief must have wings, for he could not reach the tree
by the ground. But Sharpeye could detect nothing all day which looked
like a thief. Towards sunset a little yellow moth fluttered round the
tree, and at last settled on a branch which bore a very fine apple.
Everybody could understand just as well as Sharpeye that a little moth
could not carry a golden apple away from the tree, but as he could see
nothing bigger, he kept his eyes fixed upon it. The sun had set long
ago, and the last traces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> of twilight were fading from the horizon, but
the lanterns round the tree gave so much light that he could see
everything distinctly. The yellow moth still sat motionless on the
branch. It was about midnight when the eyes of the watchman in the tree
closed for a moment. How long he dozed, he could not tell, but when his
eyes fell next upon the apple-tree, he saw that the yellow moth was no
longer sitting on the branch, and was still more startled to discover
that the beautiful golden apple on that branch had also disappeared. He
could not doubt that a theft had been committed, but if the concealed
watchman had related the affair, people would have thought him mad, for
even a child might know that a moth could not carry away a golden apple.
In the morning there was again a great uproar when it was discovered
that another apple was missing without any of the guards having seen a
trace of the thief. But Sharpeye went to the king again and said, "It is
true that I have seen as little of the thief as your guards; but if
there is a skilful magician in or near the town, let me know, and I hope
with his aid to catch the thief to-night." As soon as he learned where
the magician lived, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span> went straight to him. The two men consulted what
was best to be done, and at length Sharpeye cried out, "I have hit upon
a plan. Can you make a woven net so strong by magic that the thread will
hold the most powerful creature fast, and then we can chain up the thief
so that he cannot escape again?" The magician said it was possible, and
took three large spiders, which he made so strong by sorcery that no
creature could escape from their meshes, and put them in a little box,
which he gave to Sharpeye, saying, "Place these spiders wherever you
like, and point with your finger where they shall spin their net, and
they will immediately spin a cage round the prisoner, which only
Mana's<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> power can loosen; and I will come to your aid myself, if
needful."</p>

<p>Sharpeye hid the box in his bosom, and crept back to his tree to wait
the upshot of the affair. He saw the yellow moth fluttering round the
apple-tree at the same time as the day before; but it waited much longer
before settling on a branch which bore a large golden apple. Sharpeye
immediately slid down from his tree, went up to the golden apple-tree,
set a ladder against it, and climbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> up carefully, so as not to scare
the moth, and set each of his small weavers on separate branches. One
spider was a few spans above the moth, a second to the right, and a
third to the left, and then Sharpeye drew lines with his finger
backwards and forwards round the moth, which sat motionless with raised
wings. At sunset the watcher was back in his hiding-place in the tree,
from whence he saw to his joy that his three weavers had woven a net
round the moth on all sides, from which it could not hope to escape, if
the magician possessed the power which he pretended. The man in the tree
did his best to keep awake, but nevertheless his eyes closed all at
once. How long he slept he knew not, but he was roused up by a great
noise. When he looked round, he saw that the soldiers on guard were
running about the apple-tree like ants, and shouting, and in the tree
sat an old grey-bearded man with a golden apple in his hand in an iron
net. Sharpeye jumped hastily from his tree, but before he reached the
apple-tree the king himself arrived. He had sprung from his bed at the
shouts of the guards, and hurried to see what unusual event was
happening in the garden. There sat the thief in the tree, and could not
get away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span> "Most noble king," said Sharpeye, "you can now go quietly to
rest again, and sleep till to-morrow morning, for the thief cannot now
escape us. If he was as strong again as he is, he could not break the
magic meshes of his cage." The king thanked him, and ordered the greater
part of the soldiers to retire to rest also, leaving only a few on guard
under the tree. Sharpeye, who had kept watch for two nights and two
days, also went away to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning the magician went to the king's palace. He was glad when he
saw the thief in the cage, and would not let him out till the fellow
showed himself in his real form. At last he cut off half his beard under
his chin, called for a light and began to singe the hairs.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Oh, how
the bird in the iron cage suffered now! He shrieked pitifully and beat
himself with pain, but the magician went on singeing fresh hairs to make
the thief manageable. At last he said, "Confess who you are." The fellow
answered, "I am the servant of the sorcerer Piirisilla,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> who sent me
here to steal." The magician<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span> began again to singe the hairs. "Ow! ow!"
shouted the sorcerer; "give me time and I will confess. I am not the
servant, but the sorcerer's son." Again they singed his hairs, when the
prisoner yelled out, "I'm the sorcerer Piirisilla himself." "Show
yourself in your proper form or I'll singe you again," said the mighty
magician. Then the little man in the cage began to expand, and grew in a
few minutes to the size of an ordinary man, who could have carried off a
golden apple easily. He was taken down from the tree in the cage, and
asked where the stolen apples were hidden. He offered to show the place
himself, but Sharpeye begged the king not to let the thief out of the
cage, or he would become a moth again, and escape. They were obliged to
singe his hair many times before he would give up all the stolen
property; and at last, when all the golden apples had been recovered,
the thief was burned in the cage, and his ashes scattered to the winds.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing when the three brothers returned home at the
end of the term agreed upon. Shortly afterwards, hearing that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
daughter of a rich king in the North was destined as the bride of any
one who could perform three wonderful feats, they set out to the court
of her father.</p>

<p>The first feat was to watch a swift reindeer cow for a whole day, and
bring her back to the stable at night; the second to bolt the palace
door in the evening; and the third was to shoot an arrow straight
through the middle of an apple, which a man, standing on the top of a
high hill, held in his mouth by the stalk.</p>

<p>The three brothers were so much alike that as each could accomplish one
of the feats only, they decided to personate the same man, which was not
difficult, when they trimmed their beards to exactly the same pattern.</p>

<p>Swiftfoot went first to the king, and the princess peeped at him through
the crack of the door, and fell in love with him, wishing she could
hobble the reindeer's feet that the handsome man might win her. However,
he found that he was easily a match for the reindeer, though she could
have run across the world in a single day. In the evening he brought the
cow back to her stable, and after supper returned to his brothers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Next day, Quickhand dressed himself up like his brother, and went to the
court, where every one took him for Swiftfoot. The princess again peeped
at him, and wished she could drive away the witch from the palace door.
This witch was accustomed to change herself into the iron door bar, and
if any one climbed a ladder to close it, she would grasp his hand, and
set the folding doors swinging backwards and forwards till morning,
while the man swung helpless in her grasp. But Quickhand ordered an iron
hand to be made,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> which he heated red hot, and mounting the ladder,
held it out to the witch, and shot the bolt at the moment that she
grasped it; and the door remained bolted till the king rose in the
morning. Quickhand spent that day with the king, and returned to his
brothers in the evening.</p>

<p>Next day, Sharpeye went to the palace, and it was arranged that the
shooting feat should come off on the following morning; and the princess
declared that she would part with all she possessed to ensure his
success. The man who held the apple on the mountain looked no bigger
than a crow, and fearing for his own safety, did not hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> the apple by
the stalk, but in his mouth, thinking that the marksman would be more
likely to shoot the arrow at a safe distance from him. But Sharpeye
struck the apple precisely in the middle, carrying away a bit of flesh
from each cheek of the holder with it.</p>

<p>Sharpeye declined the king's proposal to betroth him to his daughter
immediately, and he returned to his brothers, when they rejoiced in
their success like children, and then cast lots<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> for the
princess.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> The lot fell to Sharpeye, who married the princess, while
his two brothers returned home, when they bought large estates and lived
like princes.</p>

<p>The brothers are once spoken of as "Swedes," for what reason does not
appear. Another story on similar lines is that of the Swift-footed
Princess (Kreutzwald); but here the various feats, including the race
against the princess, who will not marry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span> unless she is worsted in a
foot-race, are performed by the gifted servants in the train of the
prince who seeks her in marriage.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE IDIOT'S LUCK.</h2>


<p>We find this form of the story of the despised younger son in the
"Strange Tale of an Ox" (Kreutzwald). A dying father leaves an ox to his
third son, a simpleton, who goes to sell it, and when passing through a
wood he hears a noise in a tree, and thinks it is an offer to buy the
ox; so he ties it to the tree, and takes a log home with him as security
for the money. Not receiving it when he expected, he breaks open the
log, and finds a jar of money inside. He afterwards kills a shepherd who
tries to cheat him out of it; and it is given out that the shepherd has
been carried away by the devil.</p>

<h2>THE MAGICIAN'S HEIRS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>The story of the traveller who appropriates the magical properties over
which the sons of a dead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> magician are quarrelling is widely
distributed, and frequently occurs as a mere incident in a story; as,
for example, in that of Hasan of El Basrah in the <i>Thousand and One
Nights</i>. In the Esthonian story of the "Dwarf's<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Quarrel," the
articles form the leading <i>motif</i>, but mixed up with details curiously
resembling some Celtic fairy tales.</p>

<p>A man passing through a wood came upon a small clearing, where he found
three dwarfs beating, pushing, kicking, and biting each other, and
tearing each other's hair so that it was shocking to see them. They
proved to be fighting over an old hat, composed of the parings of
finger-nails<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, the wearer of which could see everything taking place
in the world, whether near or far; a pair of bast shoes, which would
carry the wearer anywhere at a step; and a stick which would demolish
everything before it. Each of the dwarfs wanted to take all these
articles, to go to a great wedding which was just taking place in
Courland. The referee put on the hat, saw the wedding, and told the
dwarfs to stand with their backs to him, when he demolished them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> with
the stick, only three drops of water being left where they had been
standing. Then he went to the wedding in Courland, where he found a
great number of people assembled, both high and low, for the entertainer
was a very rich householder.</p>

<p>As the wearer of the magic hat could see everything hidden as well as
obvious, he saw when he lifted his eyes to the crossbeams<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> that there
were a vast crowd of little guests both there and on the door-posts, who
seemed to be far more numerous than the invited guests. But no one else
could see the little people. Presently some of them began to whisper,
"Look there; our old uncle's come to the feast too." "No," answered
others, "it seems that this stranger has our uncle's hat, shoes, and
stick, but uncle himself isn't here." Meantime, covered dishes were
brought in for the feast. Then the stranger saw what nobody else could
perceive, that the good food was abstracted from the dishes with
wonderful quickness, and worse put in its place. It went just the same
with the jugs and bottles. Then the stranger asked for the master of the
house, greeted him politely, and said, "Don't be offended that I have
come to the feast as an uninvited stran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>ger." "You are welcome,"
returned the host. "We have plenty to eat and drink, so that we are not
inconvenienced by a few uninvited guests." The stranger rejoined, "I can
well believe that one or two uninvited guests would make no difference,
but if the uninvited guests are far more numerous than those who are
invited, the richest host may run short." "I don't understand you," said
the host. The stranger gave him the hat, saying, "Put my hat on, and
raise your eyes to the crossbeams, and then you'll see them." The host
did so, and when he saw the tricks that the little guests were playing
with the feast, he turned as pale as death, and cried out with a
trembling voice, "Ah! my friend, my heart never dreamed of such guests;
and now I've taken off your hat, they've all vanished. How can I ever
get rid of them?" The owner of the hat returned, "I will soon rid you of
these little guests, if you will ask the invited guests to step out for
a short time, closing the doors and windows carefully, and taking care
that no chink or crack in the wall remains unstopped." Although the
founder of the feast did not quite understand what he meant, he
consented to the stranger's offer, and asked him to get rid of the
little nuisances.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>In a short time the room was cleared of all the invited guests, the
doors, windows, and other openings were carefully closed, and the
stranger was left alone with the little guests. Then he began to swing
his cudgel towards the crossbeams and corners of the room so vigorously
that it was a pleasure to behold. In a few moments the whole mob of
little guests was annihilated, and as many drops of water were left on
the floor as if it had been raining heavily. Only one auger-hole had
been accidentally left unstopped, through which one of the dwarfs
slipped out, although the cudgel might still have reached the fugitive.
He fled across the enclosure, bellowing, "Oh, oh, what a calamity! Many
a time have I been terrified at the arrows of old father Pikne,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> but
they are nothing to this cudgel!"</p>

<p>When the host had convinced himself, by the aid of the magic hat, that
the room was cleared of the dwarfs, he invited the guests to re-enter.
During the feast the omniscient man read the secret thoughts of the
wedding-guests, and learned much which the others did not suspect. The
bridegroom thought more of the wealth of his father-in-law than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> of his
young wife; and she, who was not altogether faultless, hoped that her
husband and her matron's cap would protect her from scandal. It's a
great pity that such a hat is no longer to be met with in our times.</p>

<h2>THE MAN IN THE MOON.</h2>


<p>Stories of the Man in the Moon are generally common. In Esthonia it is
generally the Woman in the Moon, as may be seen in the two beautiful
legends of Videvik, and of the Maiden at the Vaskjalla Bridge. The short
legend which follows these resembles that in the Prose Edda relative to
two children carrying a bucket (Jack and Jill?) who were taken to
himself by the Moon. The story of the Moon-Painter might have been
inserted here; but it seemed to come in more appropriately in another
place.</p>

<p>We meet with sons and daughters of the Sun and Moon among the Finns and
Lapps, as well as among the Esthonians.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>
<h2>VIDEVIK, KOIT, AND &Auml;MARIK<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></h2>

<h3>(<i>Twilight, Dawn, and Evening Twilight</i>).</h3>


<p>The Creator had three diligent servants&mdash;two fair and lovely maidens,
Videvik and &Auml;marik, and the slender youth Koit. They fulfilled his
orders and looked after his affairs. One evening at sunset, Videvik, the
eldest, came back from ploughing with her oxen, and led them to the
river to drink. But maidens are always accustomed to think first of
their own bright faces, and so was it with the charming Videvik. She
thought no more of the oxen, but stepped to the water's edge and looked
down. And behold, her brown eyes and red cheeks looked back upon her
from the surface of the stream, and her heart beat with pleasure. But
the Moon, whom the Creator had ordered to take the place of the setting
sun to enlighten the world, forgot his duty, and hurried down to the
earth to the bed of the stream. Here he stayed with Videvik, mouth to
mouth and lip to lip.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>But while the Moon thus forgot his duty, his light became extinguished,
and thick darkness covered the land as he lay on Videvik's heart. And
now a great misfortune happened. The wolf, the wild beast of the forest,
who could work mischief when no eye could see him, attacked one of
Videvik's oxen and tore him to pieces. The nightingale sang loudly
through the dark thicket, "Idle maid, idle maid, long is the night.
Black stripes to the yoke, to the yoke! Bring the whip, bring the whip,
whip, whip, whip." But Videvik heard nothing. She had forgotten
everything but her love.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, when Koit rose from his couch, Videvik awakened at
last from her dream of love. When she saw the evil deed that the wolf
had wrought, she began to weep bitterly. But the tears of her innocent
affliction were not hidden from the Creator. He descended from his
heaven to punish the evil-doer and to bring the criminal to justice. He
dealt out severe punishment to the wolf, and yoked him high in heaven
with the ox, to draw water for ever, driven by the iron rod of the
pole-star.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> But to Videvik he said, "As the Moon has touched thee
with the light of his beauty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> and has wooed thee, I will forgive thee,
and if thou lovest him from thy heart, I will not hinder you, and you
shall be wedded. But from thee, Videvik, I look for faithful watch and
vigilance that the Moon begins his course at the right time, and that
deep darkness falls no more on earth at night, when the evil powers can
work mischief at their pleasure. Rule over the night, and take care that
a happy peace prevails in its course."</p>

<p>Thus the moon received Videvik as his wife. Her friendly countenance
still smiles down upon us, and is reflected in the mirror of the brook,
where she first enjoyed the love of her consort.</p>

<p>Then the Creator summoned Koit and &Auml;marik to his presence, and said, "I
will guard against any further negligence respecting the light of the
world, lest darkness should again get the upper hand, and I will appoint
two watchers under whose care all shall run its course. The Moon and
Videvik shall illumine the night with their radiance at the appointed
time. Koit and &Auml;marik, to your watch and ward I intrust the light of day
beneath the firmament. Fulfil your duty with diligence. To thy care, my
daughter &Auml;marik, I entrust the sinking sun. Receive him on the horizon,
and care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>fully extinguish all the sparks every evening, lest any harm
should ensue, and lead him to his setting. Koit, my active son, let it
be thy care to receive the sun from the hands of &Auml;marik when he is ready
to begin his course, and to kindle new light, that there may never be
any deficiency."</p>

<p>The two servants of the sun did their duty with diligence, so that the
sun was never absent from the sky for a day. Then began the long summer
nights when Koit and &Auml;marik join their hands, when their hearts beat and
their lips meet in a kiss, while the birds in the woods sing sweet songs
each according to his note, when flowers blossom, the trees flourish,
and all the world rejoices. At this time the Creator descended from his
golden throne to earth to celebrate the festival of Lijon.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> He found
all his works and affairs in good order, and rejoiced in his creation,
and said to Koit and &Auml;marik, "I am well pleased with your management,
and desire your lasting happiness. From henceforth be husband and wife."</p>

<p>But the two exclaimed with one voice, "Father, let us enjoy our
happiness undisturbed. We are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> content with our lot, and will remain
lover and beloved, for thus we enjoy a happiness which is ever young and
new."</p>

<p>Then the Creator granted them their desire, and returned to his golden
heaven.</p>

<h2>THE MAIDEN AT THE VASKJALA BRIDGE.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>On a beautiful and quiet summer evening many years ago, a pious maiden
went to the Vaskjala<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Bridge to bathe and refresh herself after the
heat of the day. The sky was clear, and the song of the nightingale
re-echoed from the neighbouring alder thicket. The Moon ascended to his
heavenly pavilion, and gazed down with friendly eyes on the wreath of
the maiden with the golden hair and rosy cheeks. The maiden's heart was
pure and innocent, and modest and clear as the waters of the spring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> to
its very depths. Suddenly she felt her heart beat faster, and a strange
longing seized her, and she could no longer turn her eyes away from the
face of the Moon. For because she was so good and pure and innocent, she
had won the love of the Moon, who desired to fulfil her secret longings
and the wish of her heart. But the pious maiden cherished but one wish
in her heart, which she could not venture to express or to ask the Moon
to fulfil, for she longed to depart from this world and to dwell for
ever beneath the sky with the Moon, but the Moon knew the unexpressed
thoughts of her heart.</p>

<p>It was again a lovely evening. The air was calm and peaceful, and again
the song of the nightingale resounded through the night. The Moon gazed
down once more into the depths at the bottom of the river near the
Vaskjala Bridge, but no longer alone as before. The fair face of the
maiden gazed down with him into the depths, and has ever since been
visible in the Moon. Above in the far sky she lives in joy and
contentment, and only desires that other maidens might share her
happiness. So on moonlight nights her friendly eyes gaze down on her
mortal sisters, and she seeks to invite them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> as her guests. But none
among them is so pure and modest and innocent as herself, and therefore
none is worthy to ascend to her in the Moon. Sometimes this troubles the
maiden in the Moon, and she hides her face sorrowfully in a black veil.
Yet she does not abandon all hope, but trusts that on some future day
one of her earthly sisters may be found sufficiently pious and pure and
innocent for the Moon to call her to share this blessed life. So from
time to time the Moon-maiden gazes down on the earth with increasing
hope and laughing eyes, with her face unveiled, as on the happy evening
when she first looked down from heaven on the Vaskjala Bridge. But the
best and most intelligent of the daughters of earth fall into error and
wander into by-paths, and none among them is pious and innocent enough
to become the Moon's companion. This makes the heart of the pious
Moon-maiden sorrowful again, and she turns her face from us once more,
and hides it under her black veil.</p>

<h2>THE WOMAN IN THE MOON.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>One Saturday evening a woman went very late to the river to fetch water.
The Moon shone brightly in the heavens, and she said to him, "Why do you
stand gaping up there? You'd better come and help me carry water. I must
work here, and you dawdle about above!"</p>

<p>Suddenly the Moon came down from above, but he seized the woman and took
her with him into the sky. There she still stands with her two pails as
a warning to everybody not to work too late in the evening on holidays.
But the Moon knows no rest, and can never dawdle about, for he must
wander from land to land, and everywhere illumine the darkness of night
with his light.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<h2>POLYPHEMUS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>In the Esthonian version the Devil visits a locksmith, who promises to
cast him new eyes. When the Devil calls for them, he binds him to a
bench on his back, telling him that his name is Myself. He then pours
molten tin into his eyes, and the Devil jumps up with the pain, and
rushes out with the bench on his back, telling his companions that
"Myself" has done it. He dies miserably, and the dog, fox, rat, and wolf
bury him under the dung of a white mare. "Since this," adds the
narrator, "there has been no devil more." There is a very similar story
from Swedish Lappmark, in which the man who outwits and blinds a giant
tells him that his own name is "Nobody."<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>RED RIDING-HOOD.</h2>


<p>One of the most fantastic stories of this series is "The Devil's Visit"
(Jannsen: Veckenstedt), which, notwithstanding its subject, has an
absurd<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> resemblance in some of its details to "Little Red Riding-Hood."</p>

<p>Two men and their wives lived together in a cottage; one couple had
three children, the others were childless. One day, both husbands were
absent, and the Devil and his son knocked at the door in their
semblance, and sat down to supper. But the eldest child said secretly,
"Mother, mother, father's got long claws!" The second said, "Mother,
mother, he's got a tail too!" And the youngest added, "Mother, mother,
he's got iron teeth in his mouth." The woman comforted the children, and
while the childless woman went with one of the devils, the mother put
the children to bed on the stove, laid juniper twigs in front, and made
the sign of the cross over them.</p>

<p>She then gave the Devil the end of her girdle to hold, by which to draw
her to him, but she fastened the other end to a log of wood, and climbed
on the roof for safety, taking with her a three-pronged fork. As soon as
the devils began to devour the supposed women,<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the elder discovered
that he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> been deceived; and his son advised him to devour the
children; but he could not get at them. Then his son advised him to look
for the mother; and he tried to climb on the roof, but the woman struck
him back with the fork, and he called to his son for help. The son
immediately rushed out of the cottage to get his share of the prey, when
a red cock crew, and the Devil cried out, "He's my half-brother," and
tried again to get on the roof. Then crowed a white cock, and the Devil
cried out, "He's my godfather," and scrambled on the corner of the
gable. Then crowed a black cock, when the Devil cried out, "He's my
murderer!" and both devils vanished, as if they had sunk into the
ground.</p>

<h2>SNOWWHITE, THE GLASS MOUNTAIN, AND THE DESPISED YOUNGEST SON.</h2>


<p>We have these tales combined in the story of the "Princess who slept for
seven years" (Kreutzwald).</p>

<p>A princess falls into a deep sleep, and is placed by a magician in a
glass coffin. A glass mountain is prepared, on which the coffin is
fixed. Up the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> glass mountain the successful suitor must ride when seven
years and seven days have expired, when the princess will awake and give
him a ring.</p>

<p>Meanwhile an old peasant dies, leaving his house and property to his two
elder sons, and charging them to take care of the third, who is
considered rather lazy and stupid, but who has a good heart.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> He
charges his three sons to watch, one each night, by his grave; but the
elder ones excuse themselves, leaving the duty to the youngest son. The
eldest brother proposes to turn the youngest out of the house, but is
dissuaded by the other, who thinks it would look too bad.</p>

<p>When the king promises his daughter to whoever can climb the glass
mountain,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> the two elder brothers dress themselves in fine clothes,
and set off, leaving the youngest at home, lest he should disgrace them
by his shabby appearance. But he receives from his father a bronze horse
and bronze armour, and rides a third of the way up the mountain. On the
second day he receives a silver steed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> and silver armour, and rides more
than half-way up; and on the third day he receives a golden steed and
golden armour, and rides to the summit. Then the lid of the glass case
flies open, the maiden raises herself and gives the knight a ring, and
he rides down with her to her father.</p>

<p>Next day it is proclaimed that whoever can produce the ring shall marry
the princess; and, to the astonishment of the two elder brothers, the
youngest claims the prize. The magician explains to the king that the
young man is in reality the son of a powerful monarch, but was stolen
away in infancy and brought up as a peasant, and the king accepts him as
his son-in-law. His indolence was not an inherent defect, but had been
imposed upon him by the witch who had stolen him. On Sunday he appeared
before the people in his golden armour and mounted on his golden horse,
but his reputed brothers died of rage and envy.</p>

<h2>THE THREE SISTERS.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>This is the familiar story of an ill-used younger sister. A countryman
was taking game to market, and his two elder daughters asked him to
bring them fine clothes, but the youngest asked him to bring her
anything he got gratis. A shopkeeper offered him a kitten, which he
brought to the youngest girl, who treated it kindly. On the two
following Sundays, the elder sisters went to church to show off their
fine clothes, leaving the younger one at home. She went into the garden,
and a pied magpie settled on the fence, which the cat pursued, and on
the first Sunday it dropped a gold brooch, and on the second two gold
rings.</p>

<p>As the third Sunday was wet, the two elder sisters stayed at home, but
sent the youngest to church; so she adorned herself with her finery and
set out, and at church she attracted general attention. When her sisters
heard of it, they insisted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> on knowing her secret; and they carried the
kitten into the garden several times, to no purpose, for as they had
always ill-treated it before, it only bit and scratched them. At last
they killed it, and threw it among the rushes by the side of the lake.</p>

<p>When the youngest sister missed the kitten, she went out weeping into
the wood. Her sisters followed her, murdered her, and buried her under a
heap of sand, covering the grave with reeds, and when they went home
they told their father that she had been carried away by gipsies. A
shepherd, passing that way made himself a flute, and it sang the
maiden's sorrowful end. When this reached the ears of the prince, he
ordered the body to be exhumed and carried to his castle, and by
direction of the flute, it was reanimated with water from the healing
well in the prince's courtyard. The maiden immediately begged the life
of her sisters, who were released. Her hand was then sought for in
marriage by a young nobleman, whom she accepted. After this, she begged
the prince to restore her kitten to life too with the healing water, and
the two sisters were sent to fetch it; but the reed-bed by the lake gave
way under their feet, and they both perished miserably; for neither they
nor the kitten were ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> seen again. But the descendants of the
youngest sister still bear a cat on their escutcheon.</p>

<h2>THE WITCH-BRIDE.</h2>


<p>Versions of this story are common in Finland as well as in Esthonia. One

lived with his wife and daughter in a wood. The daughter had a beautiful
face, but it was reported that her skin was of bark, and she could find
no suitors. At last the mother contrived to inveigle a youth into
marrying her daughter by means of a love-philtre, but on the first night
he ran away, and shortly afterwards married another bride. On the birth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
of a child, the witch-mother transforms the young mother into a wolf,
and substitutes her own daughter. The nurse is ordered to take the
crying child for a walk; she meets the wolf; the deceit is discovered,
and the husband inveigles the witch-mother and daughter into the
bathhouse, and burns it down.</p>

profit nor wisdom.</p>

<p>In old days a fair mermaid dwelt on the shores of the province of L&auml;&auml;ne.
She often appeared to the people, and my grandfather's father, who was
reared in the neighbourhood, sometimes saw her sitting on a rock, but
the little fellow did not venture to approach her. The maiden appeared
in various forms, sometimes as a foal or a calf, and sometimes under the
form of some other animal. In the evening she often came among the
children, and let them play with her, until some little boy mounted her
back,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span> when she would vanish as suddenly as if she had sunk into the
ground.</p>

<p>At that time old people said that in former days the maiden was to be
seen on the borders of the sea almost every fine evening in the summer,
sitting on a rock, and combing her long fair hair with a golden comb,
and she sang such beautiful songs that it melted the hearts of her
listeners. But she could not endure the gaze of men, and vanished from
their sight or fled into the sea, where she rocked on the waves like a
swan. We will now relate the cause of her flying from men, and no longer
meeting them with her former confidence.</p>

<p>In old times, long before the invasion of the Swedes, a rich farmer
lived on the coast of L&auml;&auml;ne with his wife and four sons. They obtained
their food more from the sea than from the land, for fishing was a very
productive industry in their days. The youngest son was very different
from his brothers, even from a child. He avoided the companionship of
men, and wandered about on the sea-shore and in the forest. He talked
much to himself and to the birds, or to the winds and waves, but when he
was in the company of others he hardly opened his mouth, but stood like
one dreaming.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> When the storms raged over the sea in autumn, and the
waves swelled up as high as a house and broke foaming on the beach, the
boy could not contain himself in the house, but ran like one possessed,
and often half-naked, to the shore. Neither wind nor weather harmed his
robust body. He sprang into his boat, seized the oars, and drove like a
wild goose over the crest of the raging billows far out to sea, without
incurring any harm by his rashness. In the morning, when the storm had
spent its fury, he was found sound asleep on the beach. If he was sent
anywhere on an errand, to herd cattle in summer, or to do any other easy
employment, he gave his parents only trouble. He lay down under the
shadow of a bush without minding the animals, and they strayed away or
trampled down the meadows and cornfields, and his brothers had often to
work for hours before they could find the lost animals. The father often
let the boy feel the rod severely enough, but it had no more effect than
water poured on the back of a goose. When the boy grew up into a youth,
he did not mend his ways. No work prospered in his negligent hands; he
hacked and broke the tools, wearied out the draught cattle, and yet
never did anything right.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>His father sent him to neighbouring farmers to work, hoping that a
stranger's whip might improve the sloven, but whoever had the fellow for
one week on trial sent him back again on the next. His parents rated him
for a sluggard, and his brothers dubbed him "Sleepy Tony." This soon
became his nickname with everybody, though he had been christened
J&uuml;ri.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Sleepy Tony brought no one any good, but was only a nuisance
to his parents and relatives, so that they would gladly have given a sum
of money if anybody would have rid them of the lazy fellow. As nobody
would put up with him any longer, his father engaged him as servant to a
foreign captain, because he could not run away at sea, and because he
had always been so fond of the water from a child. However, after a few
weeks, nobody knows how, he escaped from the ship, and again set his
lazy feet on his native soil. But he was ashamed to enter his father's
house, where he could not expect to meet with a friendly reception, so
he wandered about from one place to another, and sought to get his
living as he could, without working. He was a strong handsome fellow,
and could talk very agreeably if he liked, although he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span> had never been
accustomed to talk much in his father's house. He was now obliged to use
his handsome appearance and fine tongue to ingratiate himself with the
women and girls.</p>

<p>One fine summer evening after sunset it happened that he was wandering
alone on the beach when the clear song of the mermaid reached his ears.
Sleepy Tony thought to himself, "She is a woman, at any rate, and won't
do me any harm." He did not hesitate to approach nearer, to take a view
of the beautiful bird. He climbed the highest hill, and saw the mermaid
some distance off, sitting on a rock, combing her hair with a golden
comb, and singing a ravishing song. The youth would have wished for more
ears to listen to her song, which pierced his heart like a flame, but
when he drew nearer he saw that he would have needed just as many eyes
to take in the beauty of the maiden. The mermaid must have seen him
coming, but she did not fly from him, as she was always wont to do when
men approached. Sleepy Tony advanced to within ten paces of her, and
then stopped, undecided whether to go nearer. And oh, wonderful! the
mermaid rose from the stone and came to meet him with a friendly air.
She gave him her hand in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span> greeting, and said, "I have expected you for
many days, for a fateful dream warned me of your arrival. You have
neither house nor home among those of your own race. Why should you be
dependent upon strangers when your parents refuse to receive you into
their house? I have known you from a child, and better than men have
known you, for I have often watched over and protected you when your
rashness would otherwise have destroyed you. I have often guarded the
rocking boat with my hands, when it would otherwise have sunk in the
depths. Come with me, and you shall enjoy every happiness which your
heart can desire, and you shall want for nothing. I will watch over and
protect you as the apple of my eye, so that neither wind nor rain nor
frost shall touch you."</p>

<p>Sleepy Tony stood for a time uncertain what to answer, though every word
of the maiden was like a flaming arrow in his heart. At last he
stammered out an inquiry as to whether her home was very far away. "We
can reach it with the speed of the wind, if you have confidence in me,"
answered the mermaid. Then Sleepy Tony remembered many sayings which he
had heard about the mermaid, and his heart failed him, and he asked for
three days to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> make up his mind. "I will agree to your wish," said the
mermaid, "but lest you should again be doubtful, I will put my gold ring
on your finger before we part, that you may not forget to return. When
we are better acquainted, this pledge may serve as an engagement ring."
She then drew off the ring, placed it on the youth's little finger, and
vanished as if she had melted into air. Sleepy Tony stood staring with
wide-open eyes, and would have supposed it was all a dream, if the
sparkling ring on his finger had not been proof to the contrary. But the
ring seemed like a strange spirit, which left him no peace or rest
anywhere. He wandered aimlessly about the shore all night, and always
returned to the rock on which the maiden had been sitting; but the stone
was cold and vacant. In the morning he lay down for a short time, but
uneasy dreams disturbed his sleep. When he awoke, he felt neither hunger
nor thirst, and all his thoughts were directed towards the evening, when
he hoped to see the mermaid again. The day waned at last, and evening
approached, the wind sank, the birds in the alder-bushes left off
singing and tucked their tired heads under their wings, but that evening
he saw the mermaid nowhere.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>He wept bitter tears of sorrow and trouble, and reflected bitterly on
his folly in having hesitated to seize the good fortune offered to him
the evening before, when a cleverer fellow would have grasped at it with
both hands. But regret and complaint were useless now. The night and the
day which followed were equally painful to him, and his trouble weighed
upon him so much that he never felt hunger. Towards sunset he sat down
with an aching heart on the rock where the mermaid had sat two evenings
ago. He began to weep bitterly, and exclaimed, sobbing, "If she does not
come back to me, I will live no longer, but either die of hunger on this
rock, or cast myself headlong into the waves, and end my miserable life
in the depths of the sea."</p>

<p>I know not how long he sat thus on the rock in his distress, but at last
he felt a soft warm hand laid upon his forehead. When he looked up, he
saw the maiden before him, and she said tenderly, "I have seen your
bitter suffering and heard your longing sighs, and could not withdraw
myself longer, though the time does not expire till to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Forgive me, forgive me, dear maiden," stammered Sleepy Tony. "Forgive
me; I was a mad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> fool not to accept the proffered happiness. The devil
only knows what folly came into my head two nights ago. Carry me whither
you please. I will oppose you no longer, and would joyfully give up my
very life for your sake."</p>

<p>The mermaid answered smiling, "I do not desire your death, but I will
take you living as my dear companion." She took the youth by the hand,
led him a few paces nearer to the sea, and bound a silk handkerchief
over his eyes. Immediately Sleepy Tony felt himself embraced by two
strong arms, which raised him up as if in flight, and then plunged
headlong into the sea. The moment the cold water touched his body, he
lost all consciousness, and knew nothing more of what was happening
around him; nor was he afterwards able to tell how long this
insensibility lasted.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he was to experience something stranger still.</p>

<p>He found himself lying on soft cushions in a silken bed, which stood in
a beautiful chamber, with walls of glass covered on the inside with
curtains of red satin, lest the glaring light should wake the sleeper.
Some time passed before he could make out whether he was still alive, or
whether he was in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> some unknown region of the dead. He rocked his limbs
to and fro, took the end of his nose between his fingers, and behold, he
was quite unchanged. He was dressed in a white shirt, and handsome
clothes lay in a chair in front of his bed. After lying in bed for some
time, and feeling himself all over to make sure that he was really
alive, he got up and dressed himself.</p>

<p>Presently he coughed, when two maids entered, who greeted him as "his
lordship," and wished to know what he would like for breakfast. One laid
the table, and the other went to prepare the food. In a short time the
table was loaded with dishes of pork, sausage, black puddings, and
honey, with jugs of beer and mead, just the same as at a grand
wedding-feast. Sleepy Tony, who had eaten nothing for several days
before, now set to work in earnest, and ate his fill, after which he
laid down on the bed to digest it. When he got up again, the
waiting-maids came back, and invited his lordship to take a walk in the
garden while her ladyship was dressing. He heard himself called "your
lordship" so often, that he already began to feel himself such in
reality, and forgot his former station.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>In the garden he met with beauty and elegance at every step; gold and
silver apples glittered among the green leaves, and even the fir and
pine cones were of gold, while birds of golden plumage hopped among the
twigs and branches. Two maids came from behind a bush, who were
commissioned to show his lordship round the garden, and to point out all
its beauties. They went farther, and reached the edge of a pond where
silver-feathered geese and swans were swimming. A rosy flush as of dawn
filled all the sky, but the sun was not visible. The bushes were covered
with flowers which exhaled a delicious odour, and bees as large as
hornets flew among the flowers. All the flowers and shrubs which our
friend beheld here were far more beautiful than he had ever seen before.
Presently two elegantly dressed girls appeared, who invited his lordship
to meet her ladyship, who was expecting him. But first they threw a blue
silken shawl over his shoulders. Who would have recognised the former
Sleepy Tony in such a guise?</p>

<p>In a beautiful hall, as large as a church, and built of glass like the
bedroom, sat twelve fair maidens on silver chairs.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> Against the wall
behind them was a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> da&iuml;s on which two golden thrones were placed. On one
throne sat the august queen, and the other was unoccupied. When Sleepy
Tony crossed the threshold, all the maidens rose from their seats and
saluted him respectfully, and did not sit down again until desired to do
so. The lady herself remained seated, bent her head to the youth in
salutation, and signed with her finger, upon which Sleepy Tony's
attendants took him between them, and conducted him to their mistress.
The youth advanced with faltering steps, and did not venture to lift his
eyes, for he was dazzled with all the unaccustomed splendour and
magnificence. He was shown to his place on the golden throne next to the
lady, and she said, "This young man is my beloved bridegroom, to whom I
have plighted myself, and whom I have accepted as my consort. You must
show him every respect, and obey him as you obey me. Whenever I leave
the house, you must amuse him and look after him and guard him as the
apple of my eye. You will be severely punished if you neglect to carry
out my orders exactly."</p>

<p>Sleepy Tony looked round him like one dazed, for he did not know what to
make of the adventures of the night, which were more wonderful than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
wonder itself. He continually turned the question over in his mind as to
whether he was awake or dreaming. The lady noticed his confusion, and
rose from her throne, took him by the hand, and led him from one room to
another, all of which were untenanted. At last they arrived at the
twelfth chamber, which was rather smaller, but handsomer than the
others. Here the lady took her crown from her head, cast aside the
gold-embroidered mantle, and when Sleepy Tony ventured to raise his
eyes, he recognised that it was the mermaid at his side, and no strange
lady. Oh, how quickly his courage rose and his hopes revived! He cried
out joyfully, "O dear mermaid!"&mdash;but the maiden laid her hand on his
mouth, and spoke very earnestly, "If you have any regard for your own
happiness or for mine, never call me by that name, which has only been
given to me in mockery. I am one of the daughters of the Water-Mother.
There are many sisters of us, but we all live apart, each in her own
place, in the sea, or in lakes and rivers, and we only see each other
occasionally by some fortunate chance." She then explained to him that
she had hitherto remained unmarried, but now that she was an established
ruler, she must assume the dignity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> of a royal matron. Sleepy Tony was
so bewildered with this unimagined good fortune that he did not know how
to express his happiness. His tongue seemed paralysed, and he could not
manage to say more than Yes or No. But while he was enjoying a capital
dinner and delicious beverages, his tongue was loosened, and he was not
only able to talk as well as before, but to indulge in many pleasant
jests.</p>

<p>This agreeable life was continued on the next and on the third day, and
Sleepy Tony thought he had been exalted to heaven in his living body.
But before retiring to rest the mermaid said to him, "To-morrow will be
Thursday, and every week I am bound by a vow to fast, and to remain
apart from every one. You cannot see me at all on Thursdays until the
cock has crowed thrice in the evening. My attendants will sing to you to
pass the time away, and will see that you want for nothing."</p>

<p>Next morning Sleepy Tony could not find his consort anywhere. He
remembered what she had told him the evening before, that he must pass
this and all future Thursdays without her. The waiting-maids exerted
themselves to amuse him in every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> possible manner; they sang, played,
and performed elegant dances, and then set before him such food and
drink that no prince by birthright could have enjoyed better, and the
day passed quicker than he had expected. After supper he laid himself to
rest, and when the cock had crowed three times, the fair one returned to
him. The same thing happened on every following Thursday. He often
implored his beloved to allow him to fast with her on Thursdays, but all
to no purpose. He troubled his consort again on a Wednesday with this
request, and allowed her no rest; but the mermaid said, with tears in
her eyes, "Take my life, if you please; I would lay it down cheerfully;
but I cannot and dare not yield to your wish to take you with me on my
fast-days."</p>

<p>A year or more might have passed in this manner, when doubts arose in
the mind of Sleepy Tony, which became always more tormenting, and
allowed him no peace. His food became distasteful to him and his sleep
refreshed him not. He feared lest the mermaid might have some other
lover in secret besides himself, in whose arms she passed every
Thursday, while he was obliged to pass his time with the waiting-maids.
He had long ago discovered the room in which the mermaid hid herself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> on
Thursdays, but how did that help him? The door was always locked, and
the windows were so closely hung with double curtains on the inside that
there was not an opening left as large as a needle's eye through which a
sunbeam, much less a human eye, could penetrate. But the more impossible
it seemed to penetrate this secret, the more eager grew his longing to
get to the very bottom of it. Although he never breathed a word of the
weight upon his mind to the mermaid, she could see from his altered
manner that all was not as it should be. Again and again she implored
him with tears in her eyes not to torment both himself and her with evil
thoughts. "I am free from every fault against you," she declared, "and I
have no secret love nor any other sin against you on my conscience. But
your false suspicion makes us both miserable, and will destroy the peace
of our hearts. I would gladly give up every moment of my life to you if
you wished it, but I cannot allow you to come near me on my fast-days.
It cannot be, for it would put an end to our love and happiness for
ever. We are able to live quietly and happily together for six days in
the week, and how should the separation of one day be so heavy that you
cannot bear it?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>She talked in this sensible way for six days, but when the following
Thursday came, and the mermaid did not show herself, Sleepy Tony lost
his wits, and behaved as if he was half-mad. He knew no peace, and at
last one Thursday he refused to have any one with him. He ordered the
waiting-maids to bring him his food and drink, and then to leave him
directly, so that he remained alone like a spectre.</p>

<p>This great alteration in his conduct astonished everybody, and when the
mermaid heard of the matter, she almost wept her eyes out of her head,
though she only gave way to her grief when no one was present. Sleepy
Tony hoped that when he was alone he might have a better opportunity of
inspecting the secret fasting chamber, and perhaps he might find some
crack through which he could spy upon what was going on. The more he
tormented himself, the more depressed became the mermaid, and although
she still maintained a cheerful countenance, her friendliness no longer
came from the heart as before.</p>

<p>Some weeks passed by, and matters remained at a standstill, neither
worse nor better, when one Thursday Sleepy Tony found a small space near
the window where the curtains had slightly shifted, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> that he could
look into the chamber. The secret chamber had no floor, but looked like
a great square tank, filled with water many feet deep. Herein swam his
much-loved mermaid. From her head to her middle she was a beautiful
woman, but from the navel downwards she was wholly a fish, covered with
scales and provided with fins. Sometimes she threshed the water with her
broad fish's tail and it dashed high up.</p>

<p>The spy shrunk back confounded and made his way home very sorrowfully.
What would he not have given to have blotted the sight from his memory!
He thought of one thing and another, but could not decide on what to do.</p>

<p>In the evening the cock crowed three times as usual, but the mermaid did
not come back to him. He lay awake all night, but the fair one never
came. She did not return till morning, when she was clad in black
mourning garments and her face was covered with a thin silk
handkerchief. Then she said, weeping, "O thou unhappy one! to have
brought our happy life to an end by thy folly! Thou seest me to-day for
the last time, and must return to thy former condition, and this thou
hast brought upon thyself. Farewell, for the last time."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sudden crash and a tremendous noise, as if the floor was
giving way beneath his feet, and Sleepy Tony was hurled down stunned,
and could not perceive what was happening to himself or about him.</p>

<p>No one knows how long afterwards it may have been when he recovered from
his swoon, and found himself on the sea-shore close to the rock on which
the fair mermaid had sat when she entered into the bond of friendship
with him. Instead of the magnificent robes which he had worn every day
in the dwelling of the mermaid, he found himself dressed in his old
clothes, which were now much older and more ragged than he could
possibly have supposed. Our friend's happy days were over, and no
remorse, however bitter, could bring them back.</p>

<p>He walked on till he reached the first houses of his village. They were
standing in the same places, but yet looked different. But what appeared
to him much more wonderful when he looked round, was that the people
were all strangers, and he did not meet a single face which he knew.</p>

<p>The people all looked strangely at him, too, as though he was a monster.
Sleepy Tony went on to the farm of his parents, but here too he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
encountered only strangers, who knew him not, and whom he did not know.
He asked in amazement for his father and brothers, but no one could tell
him anything about them. At length an infirm old man came up, leaning on
a stick, and said, "Peasant, the farmer whom you ask after has been
sleeping in the ground for more than thirty years, and his sons must be
dead too. How comes it, my good old man, that you ask after people who
have been so long forgotten?" The words "old man" took Sleepy Tony so
much aback that he was unable to ask another question. He felt his limbs
trembling, turned his back on the strange people, and went out at the
gate. The expression "old man" left him no peace; it fell upon him with
a crushing weight, and his feet refused him their office.</p>

<p>He hurried to the nearest spring and gazed in the water. The pale sunken
cheeks, the hollow eyes, the long grey beard and grey hair, confirmed
what he had heard. This worn-out, withered form no longer bore the
slightest resemblance to the youth whom the mermaid had chosen as her
consort. Now he fully realised his misery for the first time, and knew
that the few years that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> he appeared to have been absent had comprised
the greater part of his life, for he had entered the mermaid's house as
a vigorous youth, and had returned as a spectre-like old man. There he
had felt nothing of the course of time or of the wasting of his body,
and he could not comprehend how the burden of old age had fallen upon
him so suddenly, like the passing of a bird's wing. What could he do
now, when he was a grey stranger among strangers?</p>

<p>He wandered about on the beach for a few days, from one farm to another,
and good people gave him a piece of bread out of charity. He chanced to
meet with a friendly young fellow, to whom he related all the adventures
of his life, but the same night he disappeared. A few days afterwards
the waves cast up his body on the shore. It is not known whether he
threw himself into the sea, or was drowned by accident.</p>

<p>After this the behaviour of the mermaid towards mankind entirely
changed. She sometimes appears to children only, most often in another
form, but she does not permit grown-up people to approach her, but shuns
them like fire.</p>

<h2>HOW THE SEA BECAME SALT.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>This is an interesting variant of a story known from Iceland to Finland.</p>

<p>There were two brothers, one rich and one poor. One Christmas the rich
brother gave the other a ham, on condition that he should go to P&otilde;rgu.
On his way, he met an old man who told him that ham was a rarity there,
but he must not sell it for money, but only for what was behind the
door, which proved to be a wishing-mill. The rich brother bought it for
a high price, and set it to grind herrings and milk-soup; but he was
soon forced to give his brother another great sum to induce him to take
it back, and to save him and his wife, and indeed the whole village,
from being overwhelmed by the torrents of herrings and soup. Afterwards
it was sold to a sea-captain, who set it to grind salt, and it ground on
till the ship sank, and it now lies at the bottom of the sea, grinding
salt for ever.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>The next story, which belongs to the same class as Grimm's "Devil with
the Three Golden Hairs," introduces us to the personified Frost, who is
here a much less malevolent being than in the <i>Kalevala</i>, Runo xxx. It
also combines two familiar classes of tales: those in which a man
receives gifts which are stolen from him, and which he afterwards
recovers by means of another, often a magic cudgel; and those in which a
man visiting the house of a giant or devil in his absence is concealed
by the old mother in order to listen to the secrets revealed by her son
when he comes home.</p>

<h2>THE TWO BROTHERS AND THE FROST.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>Once upon a time there were two brothers, one of whom was rich and the
other poor. The rich brother had much cornland and many cattle, but the
poor one had only a little corner of a field, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> he sowed rye.
Then came the Frost and destroyed even this poor crop. Nothing was left
to the poor brother, so he set out in search of the Frost. When he had
gone some distance, he arrived at a small house and went in. He found an
old woman sitting there, who asked what he wanted. The man answered, "I
had tilled a small field, and the Frost came and took away even the
little that I had. So I set out in search of him, to ask why he has done
me this mischief." The old woman answered, "The Frosts are my sons, and
they destroy everything; but just now they are not at home. If they came
home and found you here, they would destroy you likewise. Get up on the
stove, and wait there." The man crept up, and just then the Frost came
in. "Son," said the old woman, "why did you spoil the field of a poor
man who was sufficiently pinched without this?" "Oh," said the Frost, "I
was only trying whether my cold would bite." Then said the poor man on
the stove, "Only give me so much back that I can just scrape through, or
I must soon die of hunger, for I have nothing to break and bite." The
Frost said, "We will give him enough to last him all his life." Then he
gave him a knapsack, saying, "When you are hungry, you have only to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
say, 'Open, sack,' and you will have food and drink in abundance. But
when you have had enough, say, 'Sack, shut,' and all will immediately
return into the knapsack, and it will shut of itself."</p>

<p>The man thanked him heartily for his gift, and went his way. When he had
gone some distance, he said, "Open, sack," and immediately the knapsack
opened of itself, and supplied him with food in plenty. When he had had
enough, he said, "Sack, shut," and the food sprang into the knapsack,
which closed of itself. When he got home, he continued to use it as the
Frost directed.</p>

<p>When he and his wife had lived comfortably thus for some time, the rich
brother began to covet the knapsack, and wanted to buy it. He gave his
poor brother a hundred oxen and cows, and as many horses and sheep. Thus
the poor brother became rich, but he was not much better off, for he had
to feed the animals. They all gathered round him, and he was now as poor
as before. He did not know what to do, except to go back to the Frost
and ask for a new sack. The Frost said, "Why were you so thoughtless as
to give away such a knapsack? You are now just as poor as before." But
at length he gave him a new knapsack, much handsomer than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> the first.
The poor brother thanked him heartily, and went away joyful, for he
thought he had got a knapsack like the first.</p>

<p>When he felt hungry, he said as before, "Open, sack." Immediately the
knapsack opened, and two fellows sprang out with thick cudgels in their
hands, who beat him as if it was a fine art. The man was so overwhelmed
that he could hardly utter the words, "Sack, shut!" Then the two retired
and the knapsack shut. The man thought to himself, "Have patience! I'll
exchange this with my brother." When he got home, his brother noticed
what a fine knapsack he had, and wanted to exchange. The other had no
objection, and the exchange was soon effected. Then the rich brother
invited all his relatives and the distinguished people of the
neighbourhood, for he thought to use the knapsack first to provide a
grand feast.</p>

<p>As soon as all these people were assembled, the host cried out, "Open,
sack!" Then the knapsack indeed opened, but the men with the cudgels
leaped out among the people, and belaboured them so lustily that they
all fled in different directions, and some barely escaped with their
lives. They all caught it hot, both the host and his guests. When<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> at
length the host cried out in his distress, "Sack, shut!" the men sprang
back, and the sack closed. But now the bolder guests themselves gave the
host a good beating before they left. After this, things went as badly
with the rich brother as with the poor one before. He kept the handsome
knapsack, but the men with the cudgels were in it, and if he only
thought of opening it, they laid them on his back. But the poor brother
had enough for himself and his wife from the first knapsack as long as
he lived.</p>

<h2>THE SOLDIER AND THE DEVIL.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>The Devil encountered a soldier outside the town, and said to him, "Good
friend, please help me to get through the town. I can't go alone, though
I should be very glad to do so, for the two-eyed dogs<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> would surround
me in every street. They attack me as soon as I enter the town."</p>

<p>"I'd be glad to help you," said the soldier, "but one can't do any
business without money."</p>

<p>"What do you want then?" said the Devil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not a great deal," returned the soldier, "for you've plenty of money.
If you'll fill my gauntlet, I shall be quite satisfied."</p>

<p>"I've as much as that in my pocket," said the Devil, and filled the
glove to the brim.</p>

<p>The soldier reflected, and said, "I really don't know where to put you.
Stop! just creep into my knapsack; you'll be safer there than anywhere."</p>

<p>"That'll do! But your knapsack has three straps. Don't buckle the third,
or it might be bad for me."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>"All right! Squeeze in."</p>

<p>So the Devil crept into the knapsack.</p>

<p>But the soldier was one of those people who don't keep their word as
they ought. As soon as the devil was in the knapsack, he buckled all
three straps tight, saying, "A soldier mustn't go through the town with
loose straps. Do you think that the corporal would excuse me on your
account if he saw me so untidy?"</p>

<p>But the soldier had a friend on the other side of the town who was a
smith. He marched straight<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> off to him with the Devil in his knapsack,
and said, "Old friend, please beat my knapsack soft on your anvil. The
corporal always scolds me because he says that my knapsack is as hard
and angular as a dry bast shoe."</p>

<p>"Pitch it on the anvil," said the smith.</p>

<p>And he hammered away at the knapsack till the wool flew from the hide.</p>

<p>"Won't that do?" asked he after a while.</p>

<p>"No," said the soldier, "harder still."</p>

<p>And again the blows hailed on the knapsack.</p>

<p>"That's enough," said the soldier at last. "I'll come to you again, if
it's necessary."</p>

<p>Then he took the knapsack on his shoulder, and went back to the town,
where he pitched the Devil out of the knapsack in the middle of the
street.</p>

<p>The Devil was crushed as flat as a mushroom. He could hardly stand on
his legs. It had never gone so ill with him before; but the soldier had
money enough and to spare, and there was some left over for his heirs.</p>

<p>When he died and arrived in the other world, he went to hell and knocked
at the door.</p>

<p>The Devil peeped through the door to see who it was, and yelled out,
"No, no, you scamp, you're<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> not wanted here; you may go wherever you
like, but you won't get in here."</p>

<p>So the soldier went to the Old God, and told him how it had fared with
him. He replied, "Stay here now; there's plenty of room for soldiers."</p>

<p>Since that time the Devil has admitted no more soldiers into hell.</p>

<h2>SECTION V</h2>

<h3><i>STORIES OF THE GODS, AND SPIRITS OF THE ELEMENTS</i></h3>


<p>Vanemuine appears in the <i>Kalevala</i>, under his Finnish name of
V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen, as a culture-hero, though in the first recension of the
poem, as well as in most of the creation-myths of the Finns, the
creation is ascribed to him, and not to his mother, Ilmatar. He is,
however, always a great musician, and in Esthonian tales usually appears
rather in the character of a god than of a patriarch.</p>

<p>We read much of V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen's playing and singing in the <i>Kalevala</i>,
especially in Runo 46, where he charms all nature by his playing and
singing, like Orpheus. In Runo 50 he is described as leaving Finland on
account of his authority departing at the coming of Christ; though it is
said by an old writer that the favourite deities<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> of the Finns in his
time were V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen and the Virgin Mary.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE SONG-GOD'S DEPARTURE.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>All living beings gathered round Vanemuine on the Hill of Taara, and
each received his language, according to what he could comprehend and
retain of the song of the god. The sacred stream Ema had chosen for her
language the rustling of his garments, but the trees of the forest chose
the rushing of his robes as he descended to the earth. Therefore do we
feel the presence of Vanemuine most nearly in the woods and on the banks
of the murmuring brooks, and then are we filled with the spirit of his
lays. The loudest tones are heard in the wind. Some creatures preferred
the deep tones of the god's harp, and others the melody of the strings.
The singing birds, especially the nightingale and the lark, deemed the
holy songs and melodies of the god to be the most beautiful. But it
fared very badly with the fishes. They stretched their heads out of the
water to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span> the eyes, but kept their ears under. So they saw well how
Vanemuine moved his lips, and they imitated him, but they remained dumb.
Only man could learn all notes and understand everything; therefore his
song moves the soul most deeply, and lifts it towards the throne of God.
Vanemuine sang of the grandeur of heaven and the beauty of earth, of the
banks of the Ema and her beauty, and of the joy and sorrow of the
children of men. And his song was so moving that he himself began to
weep bitterly, and the tears sank through his sixfold robe and his
sevenfold vest. Then he rose again on the wings of the wind, and went to
the abode of God to sing and play.</p>

<p>Long did his divine song linger in the mouths of the sons and daughters
of Esthonia. When they wandered in the leafy shades of the holy forest,
they comprehended the gentle rustling of the trees, and the rippling of
the brooks filled them with joyous thoughts. The song of the nightingale
melted their hearts, and the whistling of the larks lifted their minds
to the abodes of God. Then it seemed to them as if Vanemuine himself
wandered through the creation with his harp. And thus he did; and when
the bards of the whole country assembled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span> together to sing, Vanemuine
was always among them, though they did not know him, and he ever kindled
afresh in their bosoms the true fire of song.</p>

<p>It came to pass, at one of these festivals, that a strange old maid took
her place among the singers. Her face was full of wrinkles, her chin
trembled, and one foot was supported by crutches. The old woman began
her song in a grating voice. She sang of her beautiful youth, the happy
days in the house of her parents, and the pitiful ways of the present,
when all joy had vanished. Then she sang of her lovers, who came in
hosts to woo her, and how she had repulsed them all. She concluded her
song with the words&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sulev's son came here from Southland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Further Kalev's son had wandered;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sulev's son would fain have kissed me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kalev's son my hand had taken;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I smote the son of Sulev,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in scorn the son of Kalev,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I the fairest of the maidens."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Scarcely had the old woman finished her song, when there arose a loud
shout of laughter among the people, which sounded far over the plain and
was echoed back from the forest. The people sang the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> old woman's last
words in derision, and their laughter was unceasing till the eldest of
the company stopped it with stern interference. All was still around.
Then an old man on a decorated seat began a magnificent song, which
filled all around with holy joy. But suddenly they heard a voice behind
him, which took up the witch's song afresh. Laughter again arose among
the ranks of people. Again the elder sternly commanded silence, and
those who were gathered round the old man and had heard his song
likewise commanded silence. Then the people were quiet once more.</p>

<p>The old man on the throne of song now raised his voice, and the people
listened to him with delight. It was a genuine song, for it met with a
response in all hearts, and moved their nobler being to heavenly
thoughts. But again a loud voice rose in the throng, which took up the
ugly chant of the old woman, and again loud laughter echoed through the
assembly. Then the old man on the throne grew angry, gazed wrathfully
down on the foolish throng, and immediately vanished from their eyes.
Only a mighty rushing and clanging was heard, so that all trembled, and
their blood froze in their veins. Who was the hoary singer?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> Was it not
Vanemuine himself? Where had he vanished to? They talked and asked each
other. But the singer remained invisible, and no one saw him again.</p>

<p>This was Vanemuine's last farewell to the Esthonian people. Only a few
minstrels now enjoy the happiness of listening to his singing and
playing in the far distance, and such minstrels only are able to move
their brothers with the divine voice of song.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>In the <i>Kalevala</i>, V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen has neither wife nor child, but the
Esthonians ascribe to him a foster-daughter, of whom the following story
is related.</p>

<p>Once upon a time the God of Song wandered musing by the banks of Lake
Endla, and his harp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> clanged in unison with the thoughts which moved his
heart. There he saw a little child lying near him in the grass, which
stretched out its hands to him. He looked round everywhere for the
child's mother, but she was nowhere to be seen. So he lifted up the
beautiful little girl, and went to Taara, and begged him to give him the
child as his own. Ukko consented, and as he gazed graciously at his
daughter, her eyes shone like stars, and her hair glittered like bright
gold.</p>

<p>Under the divine protection the child grew up from the tender infant to
the maiden Jutta. The God of Song taught her the sweet art of speech,
and Ilmarine wrought the girl a veil, wondrously woven of silver
threads. He who gazed through her veil saw everything of which the
maiden spoke as if it were passing before his eyes. She is said to have
dwelt by the Lake of Endla, where she was often seen, planning the
flights of the birds of passage, and showing them the way; and also when
she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> wandered by the shores of the lake, and wept for the death of
Endla,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> her beloved. But she took the wonderful veil, and gazed upon
the happy past, and then was she happy, for she thought she possessed
what her eyes saw. She has also lent her veil to mortal men, and then it
is that the songs and legends of the past become living to us.</p>

<h2>THE TWELVE DAUGHTERS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a poor labourer who had twelve daughters,
among whom were two pairs of twins. They were all charming girls,
healthy, ruddy, and well made. The parents were very poor, and the
neighbours could not understand how<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> they managed to feed and clothe so
many children. Every day the children were washed and their hair combed,
and they always wore clean clothes, like Saxon children. Some thought
that the labourer had a treasure-bringer, who brought him whatever he
wanted;<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> others said that he was a sorcerer, and others thought he
was a wizard who knew how to discover hidden treasures in the whirlwind.
But the real explanation was very different. The labourer's wife had a
secret benefactress who fed and washed and combed the children.</p>

<p>When the mother was a girl, she lived in service at a farmhouse, where
she dreamed for three nights running that a noble lady came towards her,
and desired her to go to the village spring on St. John's Eve. Perhaps
she would have forgotten all about the dream; but on St. John's Eve she
heard a small voice like the buzzing of a gnat always singing in her
ear, "Go to the spring, go to the spring, whence trickle the watery
streams of your good fortune!" Although she could not listen to this
secret summons without a shudder, yet she fortified her heart at length,
and leaving the other maidens,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> who were amusing themselves with the
swing and round the fire, she went to the spring. The nearer she came,
the more her heart failed her, and she would have turned back if the
gnat-like voice had allowed her any rest; but it drove her unwillingly
onwards. When she reached the spot, she saw a lady in white robes
sitting on a stone by the spring. When the lady perceived the girl's
alarm, she advanced a few steps to meet her, and offered her her hand,
saying, "Fear nothing, dear child; I will do you no harm. Give good heed
to what I tell you, and remember it. In the autumn you will be sought in
marriage. Your bridegroom will be as poor as yourself; but do not
concern yourself about this, and accept his offered brandy.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> As you
are both good people, I will bring you happiness, and help you to get
on; but do not neglect thrift and labour, without which no happiness is
lasting. Take this bag, and put it in your pocket; there is nothing in
it but a few milk-can pebbles.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> When you have given birth to your
first child, throw a pebble into the well, and I will come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> to see you.
When the child is baptized, I will be the sponsor. Let no one know of
our nocturnal meeting. For the present I say farewell." At these words
the wonderful stranger vanished from the girl's eyes as suddenly as if
she had sunk into the ground. Very likely the girl might have thought
that this adventure was a dream too, if the bag in her hand had not
testified to its reality: it contained twelve stones.</p>

<p>The prediction was fulfilled, and the girl was married in the autumn to
a poor labourer. Next year the young wife gave birth to her first child,
and remembering what had happened to her on St. John's Eve, she rose
secretly from her bed, and threw a pebble into the well. It splashed
into the water, and immediately the friendly white-robed lady stood
before her, and said, "I thank you for not forgetting me. Take the child
to be baptized on Sunday fortnight, and I will come to church too, and
stand sponsor."</p>

<p>When the child was brought into church on the appointed day, an unknown
lady entered, who took it on her lap and had it baptized. When this was
done, she tied a silver rouble in the child's swaddling clothes, and
gave it back to the mother. The same thing happened at the birth of each
successive child, until there were twelve. On the birth of the last<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
child, the lady said to the mother, "Henceforward you will see me no
more, though I shall invisibly watch over you and your children daily.
The water of the well will benefit the children more than the best food.
When the time comes for your daughters to marry, you must give each the
rouble which I brought as their godmother's gift. Until then, do not let
them dress finely, but let them wear clean dresses and clean linen both
on week-days and Sundays."</p>

<p>The children grew and throve so well that it was a delight to see them.
There was plenty of bread in the house, though sometimes little else,
but both parents and children seemed to be chiefly strengthened by the
water of the well. In due time the eldest daughter was married to the
son of a prosperous innkeeper. Although she brought him nothing beyond
her most needful clothing, yet a bridal chest was made, and her clothes
and her godmother's rouble put into it. But when the men lifted the
chest into the cart, they found it so heavy that they thought it must be
full of stones, for the poor labourer could not have given his daughter
anything of value. But great was the young bride's amazement when she
opened the chest in her husband's house and found it filled with pieces
of linen,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> and at the bottom a leathern purse containing a hundred
silver roubles. The same thing happened after every fresh marriage, and
the daughters were soon all betrothed when it became known that each
received such a bridal portion.</p>

<p>One of the sons-in-law was a very avaricious man, and was not satisfied
with his wife's bridal portion. He thought that the parents themselves
must be possessed of great riches, if they could bestow so much on each
daughter. So he went one day to his father-in-law, and began to pester
him about his supposed treasure. The labourer told him the exact truth.
"I have nothing but my body and soul, and could not give my daughters
anything but the chests. I have nothing to do with what each found in
her chest. It is the gift of the godmother, who gave each of the
children a rouble at her christening, and this has multiplied itself in
the chests." The avaricious son-in-law would not believe him, and
threatened to denounce the old man as a wizard and wind-sorcerer, who
had amassed a large treasure in this manner. But as the labourer had a
clear conscience, he did not fear his son-in-law's threats. The latter,
however, actually made his complaint to the authorities, and the court
sent for the other sons-in-law of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span> the labourer, and inquired whether
each of their brides had received the same portion. The men declared
that each had received a chest of linen and a hundred silver roubles.
This caused great surprise, for the whole neighbourhood knew that the
labourer was a poor man, and had no other treasure but his twelve pretty
daughters. The people knew that the daughters had always worn clean
white linen from their earliest years, but nobody had seen them wear any
other ornaments, neither brooches nor coloured neckerchiefs. The judge
now determined to investigate this wonderful affair more closely, and to
find out whether the old man was really a sorcerer.</p>

<p>One day the judge left the town, attended by his police. They wished to
surround the labourer's house with guards, so that no one could get out
and carry away the treasure. The avaricious son-in-law accompanied them
as guide. When they reached the wood in which the labourer's house
stood, guards were posted on all sides, with strict orders not to allow
any one to pass till the matter had been fully investigated. The rest
left their horses behind, and followed the footpath to the cottage. The
son-in-law warned them to advance slowly and silently, for fear the
sorcerer might see them coming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span> and escape on the wings of the wind.
They had already nearly reached the cottage, when they were suddenly
dazzled by the wonderful splendour which shone through the trees. As
they advanced, a large and splendid palace became visible. It was
entirely built of glass, and illuminated by hundreds of tapers, although
the sun shone, and the day was perfectly light. Two sentries stood at
the door, wholly cased in brazen armour, and holding long drawn swords
in their hands. The officials did not know what to make of it, and
everything looked more like a dream than reality. Then the door opened,
and a young man gaily attired in silken garments, came forth and said,
"Our queen has commanded that the chief-justice shall appear before
her." Although the judge felt some alarm, he decided to follow the young
man into the house.</p>

<p>Who can describe the splendour which he beheld! In a magnificent hall as
large as a church sat a lady enthroned, robed in silk, satin, and gold.
Some feet lower sat twelve beautiful princesses on smaller golden seats.
They were dressed as magnificently as the queen, except that they wore
no golden crowns. On both sides stood numerous attendants, all in bright
silken attire and with golden necklaces. When the chief judge came
forward bowing, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> queen demanded, "Why have you come out to-day with
a host of police, as if you were about to arrest criminals?" The judge
was about to answer, but terror stopped his utterance and he could not
speak a word. "I know the base lying charges," continued the queen, "for
nothing is concealed from my eyes. Let the false accuser enter, but
chain him hand and foot, and I will pronounce just sentence. Let the
other judges and attendants enter too, that the matter may be done
publicly, and that they may bear witness that no one suffers injustice
here." One of the servants hastened out to fulfil the order, and after
some time the accuser was led in, chained hand and foot, and guarded by
six soldiers in armour. The remaining judges and attendants followed.
Then the queen addressed the assembly.</p>

was my lover, but as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span> his father would not allow him to take a wife, we

marry, another change was effected.</p>

<p>"Each time, on the night before the wedding, I had my daughter carried
away, and that of the labourer substituted. The old King of the Winds
had been lying ill for a long time, and knew nothing of our proceedings.
On the christening-day I gave each child a silver rouble to form the
marriage portion in her bridal chest. All the sons-in-law were satisfied
with their young wives and with what they brought them, except this
avaricious scoundrel whom you see before you in chains, who dared to
bring false accusations against his father-in-law, in hopes of enriching
himself thereby. The old King of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span> Winds died a fortnight ago, and my
consort succeeded to the throne. It is no longer necessary for us to

their foster-parents, the labourer and his wife, shall dwell with me as
my pensioners till their death. But you, worthless scamp, whom I have
put in chains, shall also receive your just reward. You shall sit
chained in a mountain of gold, so that your greedy eyes shall ever
behold the gold without your being able to touch a particle. For seven
hundred years you shall endure this torment before death shall have
power to bring you rest. This is my decree."</p>

<p>When the queen had finished speaking, a noise was heard like a violent
clap of thunder; the earth quaked, and the magistrates and their
servants fell down stunned. When they recovered their senses, they found
themselves in the wood to which their guide had led them, but on the
spot where the palace of glass had stood in all its splendour, clear
cold water now gushed forth from a small spring. Nothing more was ever
heard of the labourer, his wife, or his avaricious son-in-law. The widow
of the latter married another husband in the autumn, and lived happily
with him for the rest of her life.</p>

<h2>THE FOUR GIFTS OF THE WATER-SPRITE.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>Four boys were playing one Sunday on the banks of Lake Peipus, when the
water-spirit appeared to them in the form of an old man with long grey
hair and beard, and gave each of them a present&mdash;a boat, a hammer, a
ploughshare, and a little book. As they grew up, one became a smith,
another a fisherman, another a farmer, and the last a great king, who
conquered the Danes and Swedes.</p>

<h2>THE LAKE-DWELLERS.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>Many years ago a man was driving over a lake with his little son before
the ice was properly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> formed. It broke, and they all sank in the water,
when an old man with silver-grey hair came up, and upbraided them for
breaking through the winter roof of his palace. He told the man that he
must stay with him, but he would give him a grey horse and a sledge with
golden runners, that he might drive about under the ice in autumn, and
make a noise to warn others that it was unsafe until Father Taara had
strengthened it sufficiently. But he would help the boy and the horse
above the ice, for they were not to blame. When the water-god had
brought them from under the ice, he told the boy to go home, and not to
mourn for his father, who would be very happy under the water, and to be
careful not to drop anything out of the sledge. On reaching home, he
found two lumps of ice in the sledge, and threw them out, but when they
struck against a stone and did not break, he discovered that they were
lumps of pure silver. He had now plenty to live upon comfortably; but
every autumn when the lake was covered with young ice, he went to it,
hoping to see or hear something of his father. The ice often cracked and
heaved just before his footsteps, as if his father was trying to speak
to him, but there was no other sign.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Many years passed by, and the son grew old and grey. One day he went to
the lake as usual, and sat down sorrowfully on a stone, just where the
river falls into it, and great tears rolled down his cheeks. Suddenly he
saw, on raising his eyes, a great door of silver with golden
lattice-work close to the mouth of the river. He rose up and went to it,
and he had scarcely touched it when it sprang open. He hesitated a
moment and then entered, and found himself in a gloomy gallery of
bronze. He went some distance, and presently reached a second door like
the former, but much higher. Before it stood a dwarf with a broad stone
hat on his head and bronze armour. He wore a copper girdle round his
waist, and held in his hand a copper halbert about six feet long. "I
suppose you have come to see your father?" he said in a friendly manner.
"Yes, indeed, my good man," answered the other. "Can you not help me to
see him or meet him? I am already an old man myself, and my life grows
ever more lonely." "I must not make any promises," said the dwarf, "and
it is about time for your father to fulfil his office. Hark, he is just
driving off in his golden sledge with the grey horse, to warn mortals
against treading incautiously on our delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span> silver roof. But as you
have once before been our guest, and have ventured to come again, I will
show you the house and grounds of the water-world. None of our people
are at home to-day, neither the gentry nor the household, so that we can
go through the rooms without interference." As he spoke he touched the
door, and the old man and his guide entered a vast and splendid palace
of crystal. There they saw a great crowd of men, women, and children
walking about, or sitting talking, or amusing themselves; but none of
them noticed or addressed the newcomers. Presently the dwarf led the old
man farther into the hall. All the fittings were of bright gold and
silver, and the floor was of copper, and the farther they advanced the
brighter everything shone, without any apparent end. At last the old man
asked to turn back, and the dwarf said, "It is well that you mentioned
it, for a little farther on the gold shines so brilliantly that the eyes
of mortal men cannot endure it. And there dwells our good and mighty
king, with his noble consort, surrounded by the bold heroes and lovely
dames of our realm." "You told me the gentry and dependants were not at
home," said the old man, "but who were all the people who were talking
and laughing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> near the door, and the children who were playing with all
manner of costly toys of gold and silver? Don't they belong to your
people?" "Half-way indeed, but not quite," said the dwarf. "They are, if
I may be permitted to tell you, people from your world, who all sank
into our kingdom, sooner or later. But they live a very pleasant life
here, and have no wish to return to your world, even if they were
permitted. For whoever comes to our kingdom must stay with us." "Must I
stay here too?" asked the old man startled, not knowing what
preparations he had to make for the life below. "Do you find our home so
bad?" asked the dwarf. "But fear nothing, and don't alarm yourself. This
day you can go or stay, as you please. I led you in freely, and will
lead you out freely. But this is the first time that a mortal man has
been permitted to leave our abode." Then the old man asked, "Shall I
never see my father again?" and tears stood in his eyes once more. The
dwarf answered, "You would not see him again till after three weeks,
when the ice has become strong and firm. Your father will then have
finished his work for the year, and can pass his time pleasantly with us
till another year has passed, and he must again perform his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span> office for
a month." "Must he then do this work for ever, and remember his
misfortune every year?" asked the old man sadly. The dwarf answered, "He
must perform this duty till another mortal accidentally damages our roof
and sinks down himself. Then is the first man released from his
journeying under the young ice, and the other must henceforth take the
work upon himself."</p>

<p>As they were thus conversing, the old man and his guide reached the
gate. Then they looked in each other's faces, and the dwarf gave the old
man two rods of copper with a friendly smile, and said, "If you ever
come to this gate, and don't find me on guard, but some one whom you
don't know, strike these rods together, and I will do what you wish, as
far as I can." Then he led his guest through the lofty gate, and
accompanied him through the bronze passage to the outer gate, and opened
it. Then the old man found himself standing again on the banks of the
lake near the mouth of the river, as if he had fallen from the clouds.
The door had vanished, but the rods in his hand showed him that what he
had seen was a reality. He put them in his pocket, and wandered home
sunk in deep thought, and dazed like a drunken man. But here he found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
no rest or pleasure in anything. He went to the mouth of the river on
the lake daily for three weeks, and sat on the rock as if in a dream;
and at last he disappeared, and never came home again.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Kreutzwald relates that every autumn a little grey man, who lives in the
&Uuml;lemiste j&auml;rv, rises from it to see if the new buildings are
sufficiently decorated. When he has finished his inspection, he returns
to the lake; but if he was so dissatisfied as to turn his head in the
opposite direction, evil would come on Tallin (Revel), for the low-lying
country would be inundated, and the town would be destroyed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following tales relate to beings inhabiting the sea.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE FAITHLESS FISHERMAN.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>A fisherman was sleeping on the sand, by the Baltic, when a stranger
roused him, telling him that the sea was full of fish. They fished
together all day, when the boat was filled, and the stranger sent the
fisherman to sell the fish, insisting that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span> should bring him half the
profits, and give the other half to his own wife. Next day they would go
fishing again. This went on day after day, and the stranger regularly
received half the proceeds of the work, giving back a trifle to the
fisherman in return for the use of the boat and tackle. When everything
was arranged, he used to disappear behind a large stone.</p>

<p>Thus the fisherman became rich. He built himself a cottage, and bought a
new boat, and sometimes he indulged in a glass to quench his thirst.</p>

<p>One day it occurred to him to give his partner less than his due; but
next day the results of their fishing were much smaller, and the
stranger looked at him sorrowfully. In the evening the fisherman went to
sell the fish, but gave his partner still less than the day before. Next
day, when they cast the nets, they did not take a single fish, and the
stranger said, "You have cheated me two days running, and now you must
die." He then threw the fisherman overboard, and two days afterwards his
body was found on the beach and buried. As his wife stood weeping by his
grave, a tall, strong man approached, who told her to dry her tears; for
if he had not drowned her husband, he would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> died on the gallows.
He then gave her a bag of money, telling her that her husband had gained
it honestly, and that he was the water-sprite. Then he disappeared,
leaving the money, and the widow went home and lived happily with her
children.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Another curious story relative to water-sprites is that of the mermaid
and the lord of Pahlen (Kreutzwald). The latter found the maiden sitting
on a stone by the sea-shore, and lamenting because her father, the king
of the sea, compelled her to raise storms, in which many people
perished, in order to please the Mother of the Winds. The nobleman freed
her from her trouble by breaking the ring with which she raised the
storms with his teeth, and she rewarded him with two large barrels of
gold.</p>

<p>The following short stories relate to different classes of spirits of
the air.</p>

<h2>THE SPIRITS OF THE NORTHERN LIGHTS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></h3>


<p>A certain nobleman was in the habit of driving away from his mansion
every Thursday during hard winters, and not returning till towards
morning. But he had strictly forbidden all his people to accompany him,
or to receive him on his return. He himself harnessed the horse to the
sledge, and unharnessed him when he returned. But no one was permitted
to see the horse and carriage, and he threatened every one with death
who should venture into his secret stable in the evening. During the day
he carried the stable key in his bosom, and at night he hid it under his
pillow.</p>

<p>But the nobleman's coachman heeded not the strict prohibition of his
master, for he was much too anxious to know where his master went every
Thursday, and what the horse and carriage were like. So he contrived one
Thursday to get into the stable, and he hid himself in a dark corner
near the door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not long to wait before his master came and opened the door. All
at once it became as light as if many candles had been kindled in the
great stable. The coachman crouched together in his corner like a
hedgehog, for if his master had seen him, he would certainly have
suffered the threatened punishment.</p>

<p>Then the master pushed the sledge forward, and it shone like a red-hot
anvil.</p>

<p>But while the master went to fetch the horse, the coachman crept under
the sledge.</p>

<p>The nobleman harnessed the horse, and threw cloths over the horse and
the sledge, that the people about the yard should not see the wonderful
radiance.</p>

<p>Then the coachman crept quietly from under the sledge, and hid himself
behind on the runners, where by good luck his master did not notice him.</p>

<p>When all was ready, the nobleman sprang into the sledge, and they went
off so rapidly that the runners of the sledge resounded, always due
north. After some hours, the coachman saw that the cloths were gone from
the horse and sledge, which shone again like fire.</p>

<p>Now, too, he perceived that ladies and gentlemen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> were driving up from
all directions with similar sledges and horses. That was a rush and
rattle! The drivers rushed past each other as though it was for a very
heavy wager, or as if they were on their wedding journey. At last the
coachman perceived that their course lay above the clouds, which
stretched below them like smooth lakes.</p>

<p>After a time, the racers fell more and more behind, and the coachman's
master said to his nearest companion, "Brother, the other spirits of the
Northern Lights are departing. Let us go too!"</p>

<p>Then the master and coachman drove fast home. Next day people said they
had never seen the Northern Lights so bright as the night before.</p>

<p>The coachman held his tongue, and trusted no one with the story of his
nocturnal journey. But when he was old and grey he told the story to his
grandson, and so it became known to the people. And it was said that
such spirits still exist, and that when the Northern Lights flame in the
heavens in winter they hold a wedding in the sky.</p>

<h2>THE SPIRIT OF THE WHIRLWIND.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>Two men were walking together when they saw a haystack carried away by
the wind. The elder man said it was the Spirit of the Whirlwind; but the
other would not believe him till they saw a cloud of dust, when they
turned their backs to it, and the young man repeated a spell after the
old one. When they turned round, they saw an old grey man with a long
white beard, a broad flapping coat, and streaming hair, devastating the
woods. He took no notice of them, but the elder one cautioned the other
not to forget to repeat the spell whenever he saw him. However, he
forgot it, and the whirlwind in a fury carried him many miles from home,
and ever afterwards persecuted him till he went to his friend and
learned the spell again. Next time he saw the whirlwind he was fishing;
and on his repeating the spell, the spirit passed him angrily, and a
great wave surged up from the river, and wetted the man to the skin. But
after that the spirit never reappeared to him, and left him in peace.</p>

<h2>THE WILL O' THE WISPS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>A farmer was driving home one winter evening from Fellin across the
Parika heath, when he suddenly saw a little blue flame on one side, and
his horse stopped short and would not move. It was as if he had been
stopped by a ditch. He dismounted, and found not a ditch, but an open
pit; and he could not drive round it, because there was deep water on
all sides. Presently he saw a light flare up like a torch, and then
another, till many of them were flitting about everywhere. In
consternation, the farmer cried out, "Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,
what's going on here tonight?" The horse sprang forward, as if somebody
had stuck a pin into him, and the farmer had only just time to tumble on
the sledge, when they went off at full gallop; and the farmer could say
that the name of God had occurred to him just at the right time.</p>

<p>One evening a little boy was sleeping restlessly in a village on the
island of Dag&ouml;. His father saw a small hole which had been bored in the
wall, and thinking that the draught disturbed the child, he stopped it
up. He then saw a beautiful little girl playing with the boy, and
preventing him from sleeping quietly. As she could not get away again,
she remained in the house; and when the children grew up, they married,
and had two children. One Sunday they went to church, and the wife
laughed; but when her husband asked why, she replied that she would tell
him if he told her how she came into his house. Thinking no harm, he
promised to tell her, as he had heard the story from his father. Then
she told him that she saw a great horse-skin spread on the wall of the
church, on which the devil wrote the names of all the people who slept
or talked in church instead of attending to the word of God. When it was
full, he tried to stretch it with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> teeth, but in doing so, he
knocked his head against the wall and made a wry face, and she laughed.
When they got home, he took the wooden plug from the hole, and showed it
to his wife, but she instantly disappeared through it and never
returned. The man wept himself blind, but the children grew up and
prospered all their lives. People said their mother visited them
secretly and brought treasures to the house.</p>

<p>The next story introduces us to the Gnomes, who appear to come more
frequently into contact with human beings than any of the other
nature-spirits, perhaps because their nature may be more akin to that of
man. They are seen with more or less similar characteristics in all the
mining countries of Northern Europe, whether Celtic, as Ireland and the
Isle of Man; Teutonic, as England, Germany, and Scandinavia; or
Finnish-Ugrian. They were well known to the old Norsemen as the Dvergar.</p>

<h2>THE CAVE-DWELLERS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>Once upon a time a man lost his way on a stormy night between Christmas
and New Year. He wore out his strength plunging through the deep
snowdrifts, until, by good luck, he found some protection from the wind
under a thick juniper bush. Here he resolved to pass the night, hoping
to find his way easier by the clear light of the morning. He rolled
himself together like a hedgehog in his warm fur-cloak and fell asleep.
I don't know how long he lay there before he was roused by somebody
shaking him, and a stranger's voice said in his ear, "Get up, farmer, or
the snow will bury you, and you will never get out again." The sleeper
pushed his head out of his fur, and opened his sleepy eyes wide. He saw
a tall thin man before him, who carried a young fir-tree, twice as high
as himself, as his staff.</p>

<p>"Come with me," said the man; "we have made a fire under the trees,
where you can rest better than in this open field." The traveller could
not refuse such a friendly invitation, so he got up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span> directly, and
walked on quickly with the stranger. The snowstorm raged so furiously
that they could not see a step before them, but when the stranger lifted
his fir staff and cried with a loud voice, "Ho there, mother of the
snowstorm, make way!" a broad pathway appeared before them, on which no
snowflakes fell. A dreadful snowstorm raged on either side of the
wanderers and behind them, but it did not touch them. It appeared as if
an invisible wall held back the storm on either hand. The men soon
reached the wood, and they had already seen the light of the fire from
afar off. "What is your name?" asked the man with the fir staff, and the
peasant answered, "Hans, the son of tall Hans."</p>

<p>Three men sat at the fire, clothed in white linen garments, as if it had
been midsummer. For thirty paces or more around them, everything looked
like summer; the moss was dry, the herbage was green, and the grass
swarmed with ants and small beetles; but afar off Hans heard the blasts
of wind and the raging of the storm. Still stranger seemed the burning
fire, which spread a bright light around, but threw up no smoke. "What
think you, tall Hans' son? isn't this a better resting-place for the
night than under the juniper bush in the open field?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span> Hans assented,
and thanked the stranger for bringing him there. Then he took off his
fur-cloak, rolled it up as a pillow for his head, and lay down in the
glow of the fire. The man with the fir staff took his flask from under a
bush and offered Hans a drink, which tasted most excellent, and warmed
his heart. He then lay down too, and began conversing with his
companions in a foreign language, of which Hans could not understand a
word; and Hans presently fell asleep.</p>

<p>When he awoke, he found himself lying in a strange place, where was
neither wood nor fire. He rubbed his eyes, and tried to recollect what
had happened to him the night before, and thought he must have been
dreaming, but he could not understand how he came to be lying in quite a
strange place. A great noise resounded from a distance, and he felt the
ground under his feet tremble. Hans listened for some time to find out
where the noise came from, and then determined to follow it, hoping to
find some people. Presently he reached the entrance to a cavern, from
which the noise proceeded, and where a fire was shining. When he
entered, he found a huge smithy filled with bellows and anvils, and
seven workmen stood round each<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> anvil. But stranger smiths were not to
be found in the world. They were not higher than the knee of an ordinary
man, and their heads were larger than their own bodies, and they wielded
hammers more than twice as large as themselves. But they smote on the
anvil so lustily with these huge iron hammers that the strongest man
could not have struck harder. The little smiths were clad in leathern
aprons which reached from the neck to the feet; but at the back their
bodies were as naked as God had made them. In the background a high
bench stood against the wall, on which sat Hans' friend with the fir
staff, and looked sharply after the work of the little journeymen. A
large can stood at his feet, from which the workmen took a drink now and
then. The master of the smithy was no longer dressed in white, as on the
previous day, but wore a black sooty coat, and round his waist a
leathern belt with a great buckle. Now and then he made a sign to the
workmen with his fir staff, for the noise was so great that no human
voice could have been heard. Hans was uncertain whether any one had
noticed him, for both master and men continued their work without paying
any attention<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span> to the stranger. After some hours, the little smiths were
allowed to rest; the bellows were stopped, and the heavy hammers thrown
on the ground. When the workmen had left, the master rose from the
bench, and called to Hans to approach.</p>

<p>Oh, what riches and treasure Hans beheld there! All sorts of gold and
silver lay about everywhere, and glittered and gleamed before his eyes.
Hans amused himself by counting the bars of gold in a single heap, and
had just counted up to five hundred and seventy, when the master turned
round and said, smiling, "You'd better leave off, for it will take up
too much time. You would do better to take some bars from the heap, for
I will give you them as a remembrance."</p>

<p>Of course Hans needed no second invitation. He grasped one of the bars
of gold with both hands, but could not even move it, much less lift it
from its place. The master laughed, and said, "Poor delicate flea! you
cannot carry off even the least of my treasures, so you must feast your
eyes on them instead." He then led Hans into another room, and through a
third, fourth, fifth, and sixth of these treasure-caverns, till they
reached the seventh, which was as big as a large church, and, like the
others,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> was crammed with heaps of gold and silver from floor to
ceiling. Hans marvelled at these immeasurable riches, which could easily
have bought up all the kingdoms in the world, but which were now lying
useless underground. So he asked the master, "Why do you store up these
vast treasures here, where no human being can derive any benefit from
the gold and silver? If these treasures came into the hands of men, they
would all be rich, and nobody would have to work or suffer distress."</p>

<p>"It is for this very reason," answered the master, "that I cannot hand
over these treasures to mankind. The whole world would perish from
sloth, if no one needed longer to work for his daily bread. Man is
created to sustain himself by toil and thrift."</p>

<p>But Hans did not like this view of the matter, and disputed
energetically with the master. At last he asked him to explain how it
was that all this gold and silver was the property of one man and was
left to rust, and why the master of the treasure incessantly laboured to
increase it when he had already such an amazing superfluity of riches.
The master answered, "I am not a man, although I have the form and
appearance of one. I belong to a nobler race, which was formed by the
decree of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span> Creator to rule the world.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> By his decree, I must work
constantly with my little companions to prepare gold and silver under
the earth, and every year a small portion is assigned to the use of men,
but not more than just sufficient for their necessities. No one is
allowed to receive the gift without trouble. So we are obliged to pound
up the gold first, and mix the grains with earth, clay, and sand, and
they are afterwards found by chance in this mass, and must be diligently
sought for. But, my friend, we must break off our conversation, for it
is almost noon. If you would like to look at my treasures longer, stay
here, and rejoice your heart with the glitter of gold till I come to
call you to dinner." Thereupon he left Hans alone.</p>

<p>Hans wandered about again from one treasure-chamber to another, and now
and then he attempted to lift one of the smaller pieces of gold, but
found it quite impossible. In former times, he had often heard clever
people say how heavy gold was, but he would never believe it. Now,
however, he learned it from his own experience. After a time the master
returned, but he was so much altered that Hans did not recognise him at
first sight. He wore red flame-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>coloured silken robes, richly decorated
with golden lace and golden fringes. He wore a broad gold belt round his
waist, and a gold crown adorned his head, sparkling with jewels like
stars on a clear winter's night. Instead of the fir staff, he now held a
small gold sceptre in his hand, which branched in such a way that it
looked like a shoot of the great fir staff.</p>

<p>After the royal master of the treasure had locked the doors of the
treasure-chambers and put the key in his pocket, he took Hans by the
hand and led him from the smithy to another room where dinner was set
out. The seats and tables were of silver, and in the midst of the room
stood a beautiful dinner-table, with a silver chair on each side. All
the utensils, such as cups, dishes, plates, jugs, and mugs, were of
gold. When the master and his guest had seated themselves at the table,
twelve dishes were presented in succession. The waiters were just like
the little men in the smithy, only that they were not naked, but wore
clean white clothes. Their quickness and dexterity was very remarkable,
for although they did not appear to be provided with wings, they moved
about as lightly as birds. They were not tall enough to reach the table,
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> were obliged to skip up to it like fleas. Meantime they held the
great dishes and tureens in their hands, and were so skilful that they
did not spill a drop of the contents. During dinner the little waiters
poured mead and delicate wines into the mugs, and handed them to the
company. The master carried on a friendly conversation, and explained
many mysteries to Hans. Thus, when they came to talk over his nocturnal
meeting with Hans, he said, "Between Christmas and New Year I am
accustomed to amuse myself by wandering about the world, to watch the
doings of men, and to make myself acquainted with some of them. I cannot
say anything very remarkable about those whom I have seen and talked to.
Most men live only to injure and plague each other. Everybody complains
more or less of others. Nobody regards his own faults and failings, but
lays the blame on others for what he has done himself."</p>

<p>Hans tried his best to dispute the truth of these words, but his
friendly host made the waiters fill his glass so heedfully that his
tongue became too heavy at last to utter another word, and he was
equally unable to understand what his host said. Presently he fell
asleep in his chair, and knew nothing more of what happened.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>While he slept, he had wonderfully vivid dreams, in which the gold bars
constantly floated before him. As he felt much stronger in his dreams,
he took a few gold bars on his back, and easily carried them away. But
at last his strength failed under the heavy burden, and he was obliged
to sit down and take breath. Then he heard loud voices, which he took to
be the singing of the little smiths, and the bright fire from their
forges shone in his eyes. When he looked up, blinking, he saw the green
wood around him. He was lying on the flowery herbage, and it was not the
forge fires, but the sun-rays which shone cheerfully on his face. He
shook off his drowsiness, but it was some time before he could fully
recall what had happened to him.</p>

<p>At last, when he had fully recovered his recollection, everything seemed
so strange and wonderful to him that he could not reconcile it with the
ordinary course of events. Hans reflected how he had wandered from the
path during a stormy winter night between Christmas and New Year, and
what had happened to him afterwards came back to his recollection. He
had slept by a fire with a stranger, and next day the stranger, who
carried a fir staff,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> had received him as his guest. He had dined with
him and had drunk a good deal; in short, he had spent a few days in
jollity and carousal. But now it was the height of summer all around
him; there must be magic in it all. When he stood up, he found that he
was close by the ashes of an extinguished fire, which shone wonderfully
in the sun. But when he examined the place more carefully, he saw that
the supposed heap of ashes was fine silver dust, and the remaining
sticks were bright gold. Oh, what luck! where could he find a bag in
which to carry the treasure home? Necessity is the mother of invention.
Hans pulled off his winter fur coat, swept the silver ashes together, so
that not a particle was left, put the gold faggots and silver ashes into
the fur, and tied it together with his belt like a bag, so that nothing
could fall out. Although it was not a large bundle, he found it awfully
heavy, so that he had to drag it manfully before he could find a
suitable place to hide his treasure.</p>

<p>Thus Hans became suddenly enriched by an unexpected stroke of good
fortune, and might have bought himself an estate. But after taking
counsel with himself, he decided that it was better for him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span> to leave
his old dwelling-place, and to look for a fresh one at some distance,
where the people did not know him. There he bought himself a nice piece
of land, and he had still a good stock of money left over. Then he took
to himself a wife, and lived happily like a rich man to the end of his
days. Before his death he told his children his secret, and how he had
visited the master of the underground treasures, who had made him rich.
The story was spread about by his children and grandchildren.</p>

<h2>THE COMPASSIONATE WOODCUTTER.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>This is a story of a man who went into the forest to fell wood, but each
tree begged for mercy in a human voice, and he desisted. Afterwards an
old man emerged from the thicket. He had a long grey beard, a shirt of
birch-bark, and a coat of pine-bark, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> he thanked the woodcutter for
sparing his children, and gave him a golden rod, which would fulfil all
wishes that were not so extravagant as to be impossible.</p>

<p>If he wanted a building erected, he was to bend the rod down three times
towards an ant-hill, but not to strike it, for fear of hurting the ants.
If he wanted food, he must ask the kettle to prepare what he wanted; and
if he wanted honey, he must show the rod to the bees, who would bring
him more than he needed, and the trees should yield sap, milk, and
salve. If he needed fabrics, the loom would prepare all he needed. Then
the old man declared himself to be the wood-god and disappeared.</p>

<p>But the man found a quarrelsome wife at home, who abused him for
bringing no wood, and wished that all the birch twigs in the forest
would turn to rods for the lazy hide. "Let it be so," said the man to
the rod, and his wife got a sound birching.</p>

<p>Then he ordered the ants to build him a new storehouse in the enclosure,
and next morning it was finished. He now lived a happy life, and left
the rod to his children; but in the third generation it fell to a
foolish man, who began to demand all sorts of absurd and impossible
things. At length he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> ordered the rod to fetch the sun and stars from
heaven to warm his back. But although the sun did not move, God sent
down such hot rays from it, that the offender and all his house and
goods were burned up, so that no trace of them was left. What became of
the rod is unknown, but it is thought that the trees in the wood were so
terrified by the fire that they have never spoken a word since.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is a short Christian variant of this story (Jannsen: Veckenstedt),
in which the woodcutter meets not Tapio, but Jesus, who deprives the
trees of speech. But a gentle sighing and rustling of leaves is still to
be heard in the woods when the trees whisper together. When the first
fir-tree was felled, she shed bitter tears, which hardened into resin.
But her children, the fir cones, vowed to avenge her wrongs on men, so
they transformed themselves into bugs, which crept into men's houses,
and still plague and torment them.</p>

<h2>THE GOOD DEED REWARDED.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>Once upon a time a young countryman was busy raking up his hay in the
meadow, when a threatening thundercloud which arose on the horizon
caused him to hasten with his work. He was lucky enough to complete it
before the rain began, and he then turned his steps homewards. On his
way he perceived a stranger asleep under a tree. "He'll get his hide
pretty well soaked if I leave him asleep here," thought the countryman,
so he went to the stranger, and shook him till he roused him from a
sound sleep. The stranger stood up, and turned pale when he saw the
advancing thundercloud. He felt in his pocket, intending to give
something to the man who had roused him, but unfortunately he found it
empty. So he said hurriedly, "For the present I must remain your debtor,
but a day will come when I shall be able to show you my gratitude for
your kindness. Do not forget what I tell you. You will become a soldier.
After you have been parted from your friends for years, a day will come
when you will be seized with home-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>sickness in a foreign country. When
you look up, you will see a crooked birch-tree a few steps before you.
Go to this tree, knock on the trunk three times, and say, 'Is the
Humpback at home?' Then the rest will follow." As soon as he had
finished speaking, the stranger hurried away and disappeared in an
instant. The countryman went home too, and soon forgot his meeting with
the sleeper on the road.</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the first part of the prophecy was fulfilled, for
the countryman became a soldier, without his remembering anything of his
adventure in the wood. He had already worn the uniform of a cavalry
regiment for four years, when he was stationed with his regiment in
North Finland. It fell to the turn of our friend to bring home the
horses on a Whitsunday, while his jolly comrades off duty went singing
to enjoy themselves at the inns. Suddenly the solitary groom was seized
with such a fit of home-sickness as he had never known before. Tears
filled his eyes, and charming pictures of home floated before his
vision. Now, too, he remembered his sleeping friend in the wood, and his
speech. Everything came before him as plainly and distinctly as if it
had happened only yesterday.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> He looked up, and saw before him, oddly
enough, an old crooked birch-tree. More in jest than expecting any
result, he went up to the tree, and did what he had been instructed. But
the question, "Is the Humpback at home?" had scarcely passed his lips,
when the stranger stood before him, and said, "My friend, it is good
that you have come, for I was afraid that you had quite forgotten me.
Isn't it true that you would be glad to be at home?" The cavalry soldier
sobbed out, "Yes." Then the Humpback called into the tree, "Boys, which
of you can run fastest?" A voice answered from the birch, "Father, I can
run as fast as a grouse can fly."&mdash;"Very well, I want a quicker
messenger to-day." A second voice answered, "I can run like the
wind."&mdash;"I want a quicker messenger still," replied the father. Then a
third voice answered, "I can run as fast as the thoughts of men."&mdash;"You
are just to my mind. I want you now. Fill a four-hundredweight sack with
money, and carry it home with my friend and benefactor." Then he seized
hold of the soldier's hat and cried out, "Let the hat become a man, and
let the man and the sack go home!" The soldier felt his hat fly off his
head. He turned round to look for it, and found himself in his own
father's room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> dressed like a countryman as before, and the great sack
of money by his side.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>At first he thought it was a dream, till he found that his good luck was
real. As nobody made any inquiries after the deserter, he began to think
at last that his lost hat had remained behind to do soldier's service in
his stead. He related the wonderful story to his children before his
death, and as the money had brought him happiness and prosperity, he
could not suppose that it had been the gift of an evil spirit.</p>

<h2>SECTION VI</h2>

<h3><i>HEATH LEGENDS.</i></h3>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>Jannsen gives the following account of heath-spirits, &amp;c. Abstracts of
stories not included under other headings we have appended to his
general observations.</p>

<p>In former days, when trees and bushes talked, animals and birds
understood a wonderful language, and the Old Boy wandered about openly
and unabashed, and wonderful things often happened on the heaths. He who
wished to cross a heath must keep his eyes open day and night. In the
daytime, indeed, no spectre dared to appear; but it often happened at
night that people were teased and frightened on the heath. If any one
was on the heath on a summer or autumn evening, he often heard a
rustling and tapping in the bushes, and perhaps water suddenly spurted
out under his feet. On winter evenings, or at midnight, he saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> little
flames dancing on the moor, and if he went towards them, they
disappeared suddenly, and danced up again in the distance. But if a man
was on the moor at night-time, he could not escape from it till
cockcrow. If a man had to fetch anything from the heath during
hay-harvest, he heard strange voices, or heard a bird singing with a
human voice; and whoever drove across the moor in winter with a light
sledge must have heard an invisible hand striking against the
tree-trunks or the ice. Then you whip up your horse, and hasten across
the moor, if you can.</p>

<p>Jannsen also relates a story of a herd-boy who was scolding at some
girls who were gathering berries on the heath, and defying the devil;
when he was suddenly seized by the feet and dragged down into the
ground, crying for help.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE WONDERFUL HAYCOCK.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>One autumn evening a girl was going home across a frozen heath, but
though she walked fast, she shivered. Presently she was pestered by a
moving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span> haycock without a band, which pressed upon her so closely that
the hay pricked her face. This continued till midnight; but when a cock
crew in the village, the haycock vanished, and the girl made her way
home exhausted, and died within a week. Since then, the people say that
cries for help have been heard from the heath by night. But they are
very particular that every haycock shall be tied with a band. If thus
secured, no evil spirit can interfere with it.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE MAGIC EGG.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>In former days, people used to find bits of leather, and fragments of
old gloves, shoes, and hats on the moor; but if anybody took them home,
some misfortune befell him. One day a man found what he thought was a
duck's egg, and boiled and ate it; but the more he ate, the more there
seemed to be, and he could not finish it. Next morning the portion left
proved to be not an egg, but half his neighbour's cat.</p>

<h2>SECTION VII</h2>

<h3><i>LAKE LEGENDS.</i></h3>


<p>Although Esthonia is not so distinctly a lake-country as Finland,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
which is often called "The Land of Ten Thousand Lakes," yet it is a low
swampy country, with many small lakes besides the great Lake Peipus, on
the south-east, and lake stories of various kinds are numerous in
Esthonian tales.</p>

<p>Jannsen relates that Lake Kork&uuml;ll or Oiso, in the district of Fellin in
Livonia, stands on the site of a castle, the lord of which insisted on
marrying his sister. He bribed a priest to perform the ceremony, but the
castle sank into the ground with all present, and a lake arose in its
stead.</p>

<p>We add a selection of Esthonian lake-stories.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>
<h2>LAKE PEIPUS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>In former ages, a great and famous king named Karkus ruled over
Esthonia. In his days, fierce bears and bison lurked in the thick
forests, and elk and wild horses careered swiftly through the bushes. No
merchants had yet arrived in ships from foreign parts, nor invading
hosts with sharp swords, to set up the cross of the Christian God, and
the people still lived in perfect freedom.</p>

<p>The palace of King Karkus was built of costly sparkling stones, and
shone far off in the sun like gold. The palace lay near the holy forest,
where dwelt three good white gods and three black evil ones. There dwelt
the king and his court. His enemies feared him greatly, but his people
loved him as a father.</p>

<p>Although the king had gold and honour in abundance, yet one thing was
wanting to complete his happiness, for his wife had brought him no
child. He promised immense gifts to the white gods if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> they would only
listen to his prayer and grant his wish. And behold, after seven years
his prayer was answered, for the queen gave birth to twins. One was a
boy, as bold and impetuous as his father, and one was a girl, with
golden hair and eyes like blue harebells, which already smiled from the
cradle on her mother. The king was full of joy, and made great offerings
to the white gods, as he had vowed. But the black gods, who deemed
themselves worthy of equal honour, were greatly offended at being
despised by the king. So they went to the God of Death, and urged him to
gaze on the king's son with his evil countenance and to destroy him.</p>

<p>Meantime the boy grew rapidly, and became the delight of his parents.
But when he came to lisp the first word, he was struck by the evil
glance of Death. From this hour he pined away, and at length died. But
his sister, who was named Rannapuura, lived and flourished like a rose,
as the only joy of her parents.</p>

<p>But the hatred of the evil powers was not appeased by the partial
revenge which they had taken. So they contrived that when the king's
daughter was seven years old, she fell into the power of the wicked
witch Peipa. The witch carried Rannapuura<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> away to her horrible abode,
which was in a rock beneath a lofty mountain ridge in Ingermanland. Here
the poor child was compelled to pass ten years of her life. But
notwithstanding her hard servitude to the witch, she grew up to
maidenhood, and no maiden in the whole world was so fair as she. As the
dawn shines ruddy on the borders of the horizon at daybreak and promises
fine weather, so shone her gentle face in quiet restfulness, and her
eyes proclaimed the angel heart in her bosom.</p>

<p>The king knew where his daughter was imprisoned, for a good spirit had
informed him, but, mighty as he was, he could accomplish nothing against
the craft and malice of the witch. So he abandoned all hope of rescuing
his daughter from this place of suffering. At length the white gods took
pity on the king's daughter and her parents; for the king sought their
aid continually, and made them rich offerings. But even the gods did not
venture to contend openly with the mighty Peipa; so they sought to
effect their purpose by stratagem. They secretly sent a dove to
Rannapuura with a silver comb, a carder, a golden apple, and a
snow-white linen robe, and sent her this message: "Take the gifts of the
white gods, and flee from your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> prison as soon as you can. If Peipa
pursues you, call on the white gods, and first cast the comb behind you;
but if this is of no effect, drop the carder; but if this does not
detain her, and she still follows on your heels, then throw the apple,
and lastly the robe behind you. But be very careful not to make a
mistake, and throw down the gifts in the right order."</p>

<p>Rannapuura promised the dove to obey her instructions exactly, thanked
the white gods for their favours, and sent the dove home.</p>

<p>On the first Tuesday after the new moon, Peipa jumped upon an old broom
at midnight, as the witches are accustomed to do, both here and in
Ingermanland, every year, on the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth new
moon, and thus flew away from the house. The maiden stole softly from
her room long before dawn, and took the four gifts of the gods with her
on her way. She ran straight towards her father's castle, as swiftly as
she could. At mid-day, when she had already gone a good part of the way,
she chanced to look round, and saw to her horror that the witch Peipa
was pursuing her. In her right hand she swung a formidable bar of iron,
and she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> mounted on a huge cock, who was close behind the princess.
Then she cried aloud on the white gods, and cast the silver comb behind
her. Instantly the comb became a rushing river, deep and broad and many
miles long. Peipa gazed furiously after the fugitive, who was running
swiftly on the opposite bank of the stream, and soon left her far
behind. But after a time, the witch found a ford through the water,
hurried across, and was soon close behind the maiden again. Now
Rannapuura dropped the carder, and behold, a forest sprang up from it so
thick and lofty that the witch and her hellish steed could not penetrate
it, and she was forced to ride round it for a whole day.</p>

<p>The unfortunate princess had now been wandering for two nights and a
day, without tasting a morsel of bread or daring to sleep an instant.
Then her strength failed her, and on the second day the witch was again
close on her heels, when she threw down the apple in her need; and this
became a lofty mountain of granite. A narrow path, as if traced by a
snake, wound up to the summit, and showed the witch her way. Before she
could overcome this obstacle, another day had passed; but the princess
had only gone a short distance farther, for sleep had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> closed her weary
eyes, and when she awoke, and could see her father's castle in the
distance at last, the witch was so close upon her that she never hoped
to escape. In great terror she flung the linen robe on the ground behind
her. It fell broadside, and soon rushed forth into a vast lake, whose
foaming waves raged wildly round the witch. A howling storm flung water
and spray into the witch's face; her wickedness could not save her, nor
could her steed, the hellish cock, escape. He raised his neck above the
water, thrust up his beak, and beat the water with his wings, but it was
all to no purpose, and he was miserably drowned. Peipa called on all the
spirits of hell to aid her, with curses, but none of them appeared, and
she sank into the depths howling. There she lies to this day in pain and
torment. The pikes and other horrible creatures of the depths gnaw upon
her and torture her incessantly. She strikes about her with her hands
and feet, and twists and stretches her limbs in her great distress.
Thence comes it that the lake, which is named Peipus after her, always
rises in billows and stormy waves.</p>

<p>Rannapuura reached her father's castle in safety, and soon became the
bride of a prince. But the king's name is still perpetuated in that of
the church<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span> at Karkus, and the estate of Rannapungern, which lies north
of Peipus, on the boundary between Livonia and Esthonia, is named after
Rannapuura. The river which rose from the silver comb is the river
Pliha, with its shining waters. He who knows it now may understand its
origin. It cannot run straight, but twists right and left like the teeth
of a double comb, unites with the Narova, and falls with that river into
the sea. The forest, too, remained until two hundred years ago, when the
Swedes and Poles brought war into the land. The Poles concealed
themselves in the forest, but the Swedes set fire to it and burned it
down. The mountain formed by the apple of the princess is likewise
standing, but its granite has become changed to sandstone.</p>

<h2>THE LAKE AT EUSEK&Uuml;LL.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>In former times there was no lake at Eusek&uuml;ll, for it was carried there
from the district of Oiso in Esthonia. One day a great black cloud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span> like
a sack rolled up from the north, and drew up all the water from the lake
of Oiso. Before the cloud ran a black bull bellowing angrily, and above
in the cloud flew an old man crying incessantly, "Lake, go to Eusek&uuml;ll!"
When the bull came to Eusek&uuml;ll, where the tavern now stands, he dug his
horns into the ground, and formed two deep trenches, which any one may
still see to the right of the path which leads to the tavern at Kersel.</p>

<p>Then the cloud rolled on farther, till it reached the district of
Eusek&uuml;ll. All the people were making hay in the meadow, and when they
saw the black cloud, they hastened with their work, to bring the hay
under cover. Presently the cloud stood above them. First a great knife
with a wooden handle fell down, and next all kinds of fish, and then it
began to rain heavily.</p>

<p>The people hurried from the field to take shelter. But one girl who had
left her string of beads on a haycock, and wanted to save it, neglected
to escape. Suddenly the waves of the lake fell from above, and buried
her beneath them. Since that time the lake at Eusek&uuml;ll has been
inhabited by a water-nymph, who requires the offering of a human life
every year.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several other Esthonian tales of lakes moving from one spot to
another.</p>

<h2>EMMU LAKE AND VIRTS LAKE.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>Soon after the Creation, Vanaisa<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> formed a beautiful lake, called the
Emmu Lake, which was intended to furnish men with refreshing water at
all times, but owing to the wickedness of men, he caused all the water
to be absorbed by a waterspout. Now men had nothing but rain-water, and
although rain-water and melted snow sometimes filled the old Emmu Lake,
it was dirty and unrefreshing, and people called it the Virts Lake. But
at length Vanaisa, took pity on the people, who had somewhat improved,
and formed narrow channels in the earth, through which the waters of the
old Emmu lake flow as springs. But to prevent their being too warm in
summer and too cold in winter, a cold stone is put into the springs in
spring, and replaced by a warm one in autumn.</p>

<h2>THE BLUE SPRING.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>At the foot of the Villina hill, near the church of Lais,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> is a swamp
where rises a spring of water, called from its colour the Blue Spring.
It is said that the spring can produce rain or drought, and thus cause
dearth or plenty. In time of drought three widows of the same name must
go to the spring on a Sunday during service-time, to clean it out and to
enlarge the opening. Each must take a spade, hoe, rake, a cake of bread,
and a hymn-book with her. But if too much rain falls, the spring must be
closed up to a mere crevice, and this is at once efficacious.</p>

<p>One day three widows named Anna opened the spring too wide, when a
dreadful rain spread over the country. Sometimes it has happened that
women who were about to clean the spring have failed to finish the work
during church-time, and it has been fruitless. Another time the people
wished<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span> to find out how deep was the spring. They let down a stone with
a long cord, but drew the cord up without the stone. They then let down
a kettle filled with stones, but, to their horror, they drew up a
bleeding human head instead. They were about to make another trial, when
a voice cried from the depths, "If you attempt this again, you will all
sink!" So the depth of the Blue Spring is still unknown.</p>

<h2>THE BLACK POOL.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>In time of war, a rich lord tried to escape from the country with his
family and goods in a coach drawn by six horses. In their haste, the
horses swerved from the path, and all were lost in a deep lake of black
water. Since that time it has been haunted, and sometimes a black dog
tries to entice boys in, or cats and birds are seen about it. One day a
man was walking by the pool when his leg was seized, and he was dragged
down, but he contrived to seize a bush of juniper, and saved
him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>self.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> Then he saw some maidens sporting in the water like white
swans; but presently they vanished. One day a fisherman caught a black
tail-less pike, when the voice of the old nobleman was heard asking,
"Are all the swine safe?" And another voice answered, "The old tail-less
boar is missing." Many people, too, have seen a great hoop from a
coach-wheel, as sharp as the edge of an axe, rise from the water.</p>

<h2>SECTION VIII</h2>

<h3><i>STORIES OF THE DEVIL AND OF BLACK MAGIC.</i></h3>


<p>Stories relating to the Devil are very frequent in Esthonian literature,
and notwithstanding the universal notion that you sell yourself to him
by giving him three drops of your blood, or by signing a compact with
your blood, yet many stories of this class are evidently pre-Christian.
He is generally represented as a buffoon, and easily outwitted. Further
particulars respecting him will be found in the Introduction. The
stories incidentally referred to in this section of our work are mostly
related by Jannsen.</p>

<p>As regards sorcery, the Esthonians appear to have regarded the Finns,
and the Finns the Lapps, as proficient in magic, each people attributing
most skill to those living north of themselves. However, it should be
mentioned that there is a ballad in the Finnish <i>Kanteletar</i> in which
the sun and moon are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> represented as stolen by German and Esthonian
sorcerers. In the <i>Kalevala</i> they are stolen by Louhi, the witch-queen
of Lapland.</p>

<p>The first story of this series, "The Son of the Thunder-God," represents
this demigod as actually selling his soul to the Devil, and tricking the
Devil out of it. The Thunder-God is here called Paristaja, and also Vana
K&otilde;u; but in other tales he is usually called Pikne, and is no doubt
identical with the Perkunas of the Lithuanians. In this story the Devil
is called Kurat, the Evil One; and also Vanapois (the Old Boy), as in
other tales.</p>

<p>The primitive manner in which the undutiful son tickles the nose of his
august father is amusing. Vana (old) seems to be a term of respect
applied to gods and devils alike.</p>

<h2>THE SON OF THE THUNDER-GOD.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>Once upon a time the son of the Thunder-God made a compact with the
Devil. It was agreed that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span> Devil was to serve him faithfully for
seven years, and to do everything which his master required of him,
after which he was to receive his master's soul as a reward. The Devil
fulfilled his part of the bargain faithfully. He never shirked the
hardest labour nor grumbled at poor living, for he knew the reward he
had to expect. Six years had already passed by, and the seventh had
begun; but the Thunderer's son had no particular inclination to part
with his soul so easily, and looked about for some trick by which he
could escape the necessity of fulfilling his share of the bargain. He
had already tricked the Devil when the compact was signed, for instead
of signing it with his own blood, he had signed it with cock's blood,
and his short-sighted adversary had not noticed the difference. Thus the
bond which the Devil thought perfectly secure was really a very doubtful
one. The end of the time was approaching, and the Thunderer's son had
not yet attempted to regain his freedom, when it happened one day that a
black cloud arose in the sky, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> foreboded a violent thunderstorm.
The Devil immediately crept down underground, having made himself a
hiding-place under a stone for that purpose. "Come, brother," said he to
his master, "and keep me company till the tempest is over." "What will
you promise me if I fulfil your request?" said the Thunderer's son. The
Devil thought they might settle this down below, for he did not like to
talk over matters of business just then, when the storm was threatening
to break over them at any moment. The Thunderer's son thought, "The Old
Boy seems quite dazed with terror to-day, and who knows whether I may
not be able to get rid of him after all?" So he followed him into the
cave. The tempest lasted a long time, and one crash of thunder followed
another, till the earth quaked and the rocks trembled. At every peal the
Old Boy pushed his fists into his ears and screwed up his eyes tight; a
cold sweat covered his shaking limbs, and he was unable to utter a word.
In the evening, when the storm was over, he said to the Thunderer's son,
"If your old dad did not make such a noise and clatter now and then, I
could get along with him very well, for his arrows could not hurt me
underground. But this horrible clamour upsets me so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> much that I am
ready to lose my senses, and hardly know what I am about. I should be
willing to offer a great reward to any one who would release me from
this annoyance." The Thunderer's son answered, "The best plan would be
to steal the thunder-weapon from my old dad."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> "I'd do it if it were
possible," answered the Devil, "but old K&otilde;u is always on the alert. He
keeps watch on the thunder-weapon day and night; and how is it possible
to steal it?" But the Thunderer's son still maintained that the feat was
possible. "Ay, if you would help me," cried the Devil, "we might perhaps
succeed, but I can't manage it by myself." The Thunderer's son promised
to help him, but demanded no less a reward than that the Devil should
abandon his claim to his soul. "You may keep the soul with all my
heart," cried the Devil delighted, "if you will only release me from
this shocking worry and anxiety." Then the Thunderer's son began to
explain how he thought the business might be managed, if they both
worked well together. "But," he added, "we must wait till my old dad
again tires himself out so much as to fall into a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span> sound sleep, for he
generally sleeps with open eyes, like the hares."</p>

<p>Some time after this conversation, another violent thunderstorm broke
out, which lasted a great while. The Devil and the Thunderer's son again
retreated to their hiding-place under the stone. Terror had so stupefied
the Old Boy, that he could not hear a word of what his companion said.
In the evening they both climbed a high mountain, when the Old Boy took
the Thunderer's son on his shoulders, and began to stretch himself out
by his magic power higher and higher, singing&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Higher, brother, higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Cloudland nigher,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>till he had grown up to the edge of the clouds. When the Thunderer's son
peeped over the edge of the clouds, he saw his father K&otilde;u sleeping
quietly, with his head resting on a pillow of clouds, but with his right
hand resting across the thunder-instrument. He could not seize the
weapon, for he would have roused the sleeper by touching his hand. The
Thunderer's son now crept from the Devil's shoulder along the clouds as
stealthily as a cat, and taking a louse from behind his own ear, he set
it on his father's nose. The old man raised his hand to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> scratch his
nose, when his son grasped the thunder-weapon, and jumped from the
clouds on to the back of the Devil, who ran down the mountain as if fire
was burning behind him, and he did not stop till he reached P&otilde;rgu. Here
he hid the stolen property in an iron chamber secured by seven
locks,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> thanked the Thunderer's son for his friendly aid, and
relinquished all claims upon his soul.</p>

<p>But now a misfortune fell upon the world and men which the Thunderer's
son had not foreseen, for the clouds no longer shed a drop of moisture,
and everything withered away with drought.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> "If I have thoughtlessly
brought this unexpected misery on the people," thought he, "I must try
to repair the mischief as best I can." So he travelled north to the
frontiers of Finland, where a noted sorcerer lived, and told him the
whole story, and where the thunder-weapon was now hidden. Then said the
sorcerer, "First of all, you must tell your old father K&otilde;u where the
thunder-weapon is hidden, and he will be able to find means for
recovering his property himself." And he sent the Eagle of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> the North to
carry the tidings to the old Father of the Clouds. Next morning K&otilde;u
himself called upon the sorcerer to thank him for having put him on the
track of the stolen property. Then the Thunderer changed himself into a
boy, and offered himself to a fisherman as a summer workman. He knew
that the Devil often came to the lake to catch fish, and he hoped to
encounter him there. Although the boy Pikker watched the net day and
night, it was some time before he caught sight of his enemy. It often
happened to the fisherman that when he left his nets in the lake at
night, they had been emptied before the morning, but he could not
discover the cause. The boy knew very well who stole the fish, but he
would not say anything about it till he could show his master the thief.</p>

<p>One moonlight night, when the fisherman and the boy came to the lake to
examine the nets, they found the thief at work. When they looked into
the water over the side of their boat, they saw the Old Boy taking the
fishes from the meshes of the net and putting them into a bag over his
shoulder. Next day the fisherman went to a celebrated sorcerer and asked
him to use his magic to cause the thief to fall into the net, and to
enchant him so that he could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span> not escape without the owner's consent.
This was arranged just as the fisherman wished. Next day, when the net
was drawn up, they drew up the Devil to the surface and brought him
ashore. And what a drubbing he received from the fisherman and his boy;
for he could not escape from the net without the consent of the
sorcerer. The fisherman gave him a ton's weight of blows on the body,
without caring where they fell. The Devil soon presented a piteous
sight, but the fisherman and his boy felt no pity for him, but only
rested awhile, and then began their work afresh. Entreaties were
useless, and at last the Devil promised the fisherman the half of all
his goods if he would only release him from the spell. But the enraged
fisherman would listen to nothing till his own strength failed so
completely that he could no longer move his stick. At length, after a
long discussion, it was arranged that the Old Boy should be released
from the net with the sorcerer's aid, and that the fisherman and his boy
should accompany the Devil to receive his ransom. No doubt he hoped to
get the better of them by some stratagem.</p>

<p>A grand feast was prepared for the guests in the hall of P&otilde;rgu, which
lasted for a whole week, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> there was plenty of everything. The aged
host exhibited his treasures and precious hoards to his visitors, and
made his players perform before the fisherman in their very best style.
One morning the boy Pikker said to the fisherman, "If you are again
feasted and f&ecirc;ted to-day, ask for the instrument which is in the iron
chamber behind seven locks." The fisherman took the hint, and in the
middle of the feast, when everybody was half-seas over, he asked to see
the instrument in the secret chamber. The Devil was quite willing, and
he fetched the instrument, and tried to play upon it himself. But
although he blew into it with all his strength, and shifted his fingers
up and down the pipe, he was not able to bring a better tone from it
than the cry of a cat when she is seized by the tail, or the squeaking
of a decoy-pig at a wolf-hunt. The fisherman laughed, and said, "Don't
give yourself so much trouble for nothing. I see well enough that you'll
never make a piper. My boy can manage it much better." "Oho," said the
Devil, "you seem to think that playing this instrument is like playing
the flageolet, and that it is mere child's play. Come, friend, try it;
but if either you or your boy can bring anything like a tune out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
instrument, I won't be prince of hell any longer. Only just try it,"
said he, handing the instrument to the boy. The boy Pikker took the
instrument, but when he put it to his mouth and blew into it, the walls
of hell shook, and the Devil and his company fell senseless to the
ground and lay as if dead. In place of the boy the old Thunder-god
himself stood by the fisherman, and thanked him for his aid, saying, "In
future, whenever my instrument is heard in the clouds, your nets will be
well filled with fish." Then he hastened home again.</p>

<p>On the way his son met him, and fell on his knees, confessing his fault,
and humbly asking pardon. Then said Father K&otilde;u, "The frivolity of man
often wars against the wisdom of heaven, but you may thank your stars,
my son, that I have recovered the power to annihilate the traces of the
suffering which your folly has brought on the people." As he spoke, he
sat down on a stone, and blew into the thunder-instrument till the
rain-gates were opened, and the thirsty earth could drink her fill. Old
K&otilde;u took his son into his service, and they live together still.</p>

<p>In our next story we shall see the Devil and his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> companions

<h2>THE MOON-PAINTER.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>When the Lord God had created the whole world, the work did not turn out
so complete as it ought to have done, for there was an insufficiency of
light. In the daytime the sun pursued his course through the firmament,
but when he sank at evening, when the evening glow faded into twilight,
and all grew dark, thick darkness covered heaven and earth, until the
morning redness took the dawn from the hand of the evening glow and
heralded a new day. There was neither moonlight nor starlight, but
darkness from sunset to sunrise.</p>

<p>The Creator soon perceived the deficiency, and sought to remedy it. So
he ordered Ilmarine<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> see that it should be light on earth by
night as well as by day. Ilmarine listened to the command, and went to
his forge, where he had already forged the firmament. He threw in
silver, and cast it into a large round ball. He covered it with thick
gold, lighted a bright fire inside, and ordered it to proceed on its
course across the sky. Then he forged innumerable stars, covered them
thinly with gold, and fixed each in its place in the firmament.</p>

<p>Now began a new life for the earth. The sun had hardly set, and was
borne away by the evening glow, when the golden moon arose from the
borders of the sky, set out on his blue path, and illuminated the
darkness of night just as the sun illumines the day. Around him twinkled
the innumerable host of stars, and accompanied him like a king, until at
length he reached the other side of the heavens. Then the stars retired
to rest, the moon quitted the firmament, and the sun was conducted by
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span> morning redness to his place, in order that he should give light to
the world.</p>

<p>After this, ample light shone upon the earth from above both by day and
by night; for the face of the moon was just as clear and bright as that
of the sun, and his rays diffused equal warmth. But the sun often shone
so fiercely by day that no one was able to work. Thus they preferred to
work under the light of the nocturnal keeper of the heavens, and all men
rejoiced in the gift of the moon.</p>

<p>But the Devil was very much annoyed at the moon, because he could not
carry on his evil practices in his bright light. Whenever he went out in
search of prey, he was recognised a long way off, and was driven back
home in disgrace. Thus it came about that during all this time he only
succeeded in bagging two souls.</p>

<p>So he sat still day and night pondering on what he could do to better
his prospects. At last he summoned two of his companions, but they could
not give him any good advice. So the three of them consulted together in
care and trouble, but nothing feasible occurred to them. On the seventh
day they had nothing left to eat, and they sat there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> sighing, rubbing
their empty stomachs, and racking their brains with thought. At last a
lucky idea occurred to the Devil himself.</p>

<p>"Comrades," he exclaimed, "I know what we can do. We must get rid of the
moon, if we want to save ourselves. If there's no moon in the sky, we
shall be just as valiant heroes as before. We can carry out our great
undertakings by the dim starlight."</p>

<p>"Shall we pull down the moon from heaven?" asked his servants.</p>

<p>"No," said the Devil, "he is fixed too tight, and we can't get him down.
We must do something more likely to succeed. The best we can do is to
take tar and smear him with it till he's black. He may then run about
the sky as he pleases, but he can't give us any more trouble. The
victory then rests with us, and rich booty awaits us."</p>

<p>The fiendish company approved of the plan of their chief, and were all
anxious to get to work. But it was too late at the time, for the moon
was just about to set, and the sun was rising. But they worked zealously
at their preparations all day till late in the evening. The Devil went
out and stole a barrel of tar, which he carried to his accomplices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> in
the wood. Meantime, they had been engaged in making a long ladder in
seven pieces, each piece of which measured seven fathoms. Then they
procured a great bucket, and made a mop of lime-tree bast, which they
fastened to a long handle.</p>

<p>Then they waited for night, and as soon as the moon rose, the Devil took
the ladder and the barrel on his shoulder and ordered his two servants
to follow him with the bucket and the mop. When they reached a suitable
spot, they filled the bucket with tar, threw a quantity of ashes into
it, and dipped in the mop. Just at this moment the moon rose from behind
the wood. They hastily raised the ladder, and the Devil put the bucket
into the hand of one of his servants, and told him to make haste and
climb up, while he stationed the other under the ladder.</p>

<p>Now the Devil and his servant were standing under the ladder to hold it,
but the servant could not bear the weight, and it began to shake. The
other servant who had climbed up missed his footing on a rung of the
ladder, and fell with the bucket on the Devil's neck. The Devil began to
pant and shake himself like a bear, and swore frightfully. He paid no
more attention to the ladder, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> let it go, so it fell on the ground
with a thundering crash, and broke into a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>When the Devil found that his work had prospered so ill, and that he had
tarred himself all over instead of the moon, he grew mad with rage and
fury. He washed and scoured and scraped himself, but the tar and soot
stuck to him so tight that he keeps his black colour to the present day.</p>

<p>But although the first experiment had failed, the Devil would not give
up his plan. Next day he stole seven more ladders, bound them firmly
together, and carried them to the edge of the wood where the moon stands
lowest. In the evening, when the moon rose, the Devil planted the ladder
firmly on the ground, steadied it with both hands, and sent the other
servant up to the moon, cautioning him to hold very tight and beware of
slipping. The servant climbed up as quickly as possible with the bucket,
and arrived safely at the last rung of the ladder. Just then the moon
rose from behind the wood in regal splendour. Then the Devil lifted up
the whole ladder, and carried it hastily to the moon. What a great piece
of luck! It was really just so long that its end reached the moon.</p>

<p>Then the Devil's servant set to work in earnest.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span> But it's not an easy
task to stand on the top of such a ladder and to tar the moon's face
over with a mop. Besides, the moon didn't stand still at one place, but
went on his appointed course steadily. So the servant tied himself to
the moon with a rope, and being thus secure from falling, he took the
mop from the bucket, and began to blacken the moon first on the back.
But the thick gilding of the pure moon would not suffer any stain. The
servant painted and smeared, till the sweat ran from his forehead, until
he succeeded at last, with much toil, in covering the back of the moon
with tar. The Devil below gazed up at the work with his mouth open, and
when he saw the work half finished he danced with joy, first on one
foot, and then on the other.</p>

<p>When the servant had blackened the back of the moon, he worked himself
round to the front with difficulty, so as to destroy the lustre of the
guardian of the heavens on that side also. He stood there at last,
panted a little, and thought, when he began, that he would find the
front easier to manage than the other side. But no better plan occurred
to him, and he had to work in the same way as before.</p>

<p>Just as he was beginning his work again, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span> Creator woke up from a
little nap. He was astonished to see that the world had become half
black, though there was not a cloud in the sky. But, when he looked more
sharply into the cause of the darkness, he saw the Devil's servant
perched on the moon, and just dipping his mop into the bucket in order
to make the front of the moon as black as the back. Meantime the Devil
was capering for joy below the ladder, just like a he-goat.</p>

<p>"Those are the sort of tricks you are up to behind my back!" cried the
Creator angrily. "Let the evil-doers receive the fitting reward of their
offences. You are on the moon, and there you shall stay with your bucket
for ever, as a warning to all who would rob the earth of its light. My
light must prevail over the darkness, and the darkness must flee before
it. And though you should strive against it with all your strength, you
would not be able to conquer the light. This shall be made manifest to
all who gaze on the moon at night, when they see the black spoiler of
the moon with his utensils."</p>

<p>The Creator's words were fulfilled. The Devil's servant still stands in
the moon to this day with his bucket of tar, and for this reason the
moon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> does not shine so brightly as formerly. He often descends into the
sea to bathe, and would like to cleanse himself from his stains, but
they remain with him eternally. However bright and clear he shines, his
light cannot dispel the shadows which he bears, nor pierce through the
black covering on his back. When he sometimes turns his back to us, we
see him only as a dull opaque creature, devoid of light and lustre. But
he cannot bear to show us his dark side long. He soon turns his shining
face to the earth again, and sheds down his bright silvery light from
above; but the more he waxes, the more distinct becomes the form of his
spoiler, and reminds us that light must always triumph over darkness.</p>

<p>In the following narrative we have a horrible story of black magic,
which, however, is extremely interesting as showing the prevalence of
fetishism, which probably preceded the worship of the powers of nature
among the Finns and Esthonians. The Kratt seems originally to have been
nothing worse than Tont, the house-spirit, who robbed the neighbours for
the benefit of his patrons, and it is probably only after the
introduction of Christianity that he assumed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span> diabolical character

<h2>THE TREASURE-BRINGER.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a young farmer whose crops had totally
failed. His harvest had been spoiled, his hay parched up, and all his
cattle died, so that he was unable to perform his lawful obligations to
his feudal superior. One Sunday he was sitting at his door in great
trouble, just as the people were going to church. Presently Michel, an
old fellow who used to wander about the country, came up. He had a bad
reputation; people said that he was a wizard, and that he used to suck
the milk from the cows, to bring storms and hail upon the crops, and
diseases upon the people. So he was never allowed to depart without alms
when he visited a farm.</p>

<p>"Good day, farmer," said Michel, advancing.</p>

<p>"God bless you," answered the other.</p>

<p>"What ails you?" said the old man. "You are looking very miserable."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span></p>

<p>"Alas! everything is going with me badly enough. But it is a good thing
that you have come. People say that you have power to do much evil, but
that you are a clever fellow. Perhaps you can help me."</p>

<p>"People talk evil of others because they themselves are evil," answered
the old man. "But what is to be done?"</p>

<p>The farmer told him all his misfortunes, and Michel said, "Would you
like to escape from all your troubles, and to become a rich man all at
once?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart!" cried the other.</p>

<p>Old Michel answered, with a smile, "If I were as young and strong as
you, and if I had sufficient courage to face the darkness of night, and
knew how to hold my tongue, I know what I'd do."</p>

<p>"Only tell me what you know. I will do anything if I can only become
rich, for I am weary of my life at present."</p>

<p>Then the old man looked cautiously round on all sides, and then said in
a whisper, "Do you know what a Kratt is?"</p>

<p>The farmer was startled, and answered, "I don't know exactly, but I have
heard dreadful tales about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you," said the old man. "Mark you, it is a creature that
anybody can make for himself, but it must be done so secretly that no
human eye sees it. Its body is a broomstick, its head a broken jug, its
nose a piece of glass, and its arms two reels which have been used by an
old crone of a hundred years. All these things are easy to procure. You
must set up this creature on three Thursday evenings at a cross-road,
and animate it with the words which I will teach you. On the third
Thursday the creature will come to life."</p>

<p>"God preserve us from the evil one!" cried the farmer.</p>

<p>"What! you are frightened? Have I told you too much already?"</p>

<p>"No, I'm not frightened at all. Go on."</p>

<p>The old man continued, "This creature is then your servant, for you have
brought him to life at a cross-road. Nobody can see him but his master.
He will bring him all kinds of money, corn, and hay, as often as he
likes, but not more at once than a man's burden."</p>

<p>"But, old man, if you knew all this, why haven't you yourself made such
a useful treasure-carrier, instead of which you have remained poor all
your life?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have been about to do it a hundred times, and have made a beginning a
hundred times, but my courage always failed me. I had a friend who
possessed such a treasure-carrier, and often told me about it, but I
could not screw up courage to follow his example. My friend died, and
the creature, left without a master, lived in the village for a long
time, and wrought all manner of tricks among the people. He once tore
all a woman's yarn to pieces; but when it was discovered, and they were
going to remove it, they found a heap of money underneath. After this no
more was seen of the creature. At that time I should have been glad
enough to have a treasure-bringer, but I am now old and grey, and think
no more of it."</p>

<p>"I've plenty of courage," said the farmer; "but wouldn't it be better
for me to consult the parson about it?"</p>

<p>"No; you mustn't mention it to anybody, but least of all to the parson;
for if you call the creature to life, you sell your soul to the devil."</p>

<p>The farmer started back in horror.</p>

<p>"Don't be frightened," said the old man. "You are sure of a long life in
exchange, and of all your heart desires. And if you feel that your last
hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> is approaching, you can always escape from the clutches of the
evil one, if you are clever enough to get rid of your familiar."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>"But how can this be done?"</p>

<p>"If you give him a task which he is unable to perform, you are rid of
him for the future. But you must set about it very circumspectly, for he
is not easy to outwit. The peasant of whom I told you wanted to get rid
of his familiar, and ordered him to fill a barrel of water with a sieve.
But the creature fetched and spilled water, and did not rest till the
barrel was filled with the drops which hung on the sieve."</p>

<p>"So he died, without getting rid of the creature?"</p>

<p>"Yes; why didn't he manage the affair better? But I have something more
to tell you. The creature must be well fed, if he is to be kept in
good-humour. A peasant once put a dish of broth under the roof for his
familiar, as he was in the habit of doing. But a labourer saw it, so he
ate the broth, and filled the dish with sand. The familiar came that
night, and beat the farmer unmercifully, and continued to do so every
night till he discovered the reason, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span> put a fresh dish of broth
under the roof. After this he let him alone. And now you know all," said
the old man.</p>

<p>The farmer sat silent, and at last replied, "There is much about it that
is unpleasant, Michel."</p>

<p>"You asked for my advice," answered the old man, "and I have given it
you. You must make your own choice. Want and misery have come upon you.
This is the only way in which you can save yourself and become a rich
man; and if you are only a little prudent, you will cheat the devil out
of your soul into the bargain."</p>

<p>After some reflection, the farmer answered, "Tell me the words which I
am to repeat on the Thursdays."</p>

<p>"What will you give me, then?" said the old man.</p>

<p>"When I have the treasure-bringer, you shall live the life of a
gentleman."</p>

<p>"Come, then," said the old man, and they entered the house together.</p>

<p>After this Sunday the young farmer was seen no more in the village. He
neglected his work in the fields, and left what little was left there to
waste, and his household management went all astray.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> His man loafed
about the public-houses, and his maid-servant slept at home, for her
master himself never looked after anything.</p>

<p>In the meantime the farmer sat in his smoky room. He kept the door
locked, and the windows closely curtained. Here he worked hard day and
night at the creature in a dark corner by the light of a pine-splinter.
He had procured everything necessary, even the reels on which a crone of
a hundred years old had spun. He put all the parts together carefully,
fixed the old pot on the broomstick, made the nose of a bit of glass,
and painted in the eyes and mouth red. He wrapped the body in coloured
rags, according to his instructions, and all the time he thought with a
shudder that it was now in his power to bring this uncanny creature to
life, and that he must remain with him till his end. But when he thought
of the riches and treasures, all his horror vanished. At length the
creature was finished, and on the following Thursday the farmer carried
it after nightfall to the cross-roads in the wood. There he put down the
creature, seated himself on a stone, and waited. But every time he
looked at the creature he nearly fell to the ground with terror. If only
a breeze sprung up,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> it went through the marrow of his bones, and if
only the screech-owl cried afar off, he thought he heard the croaking of
the creature, and the blood froze in his veins. Morning came at last,
and he seized the creature, and slunk away cautiously home.</p>

<p>On the second Thursday it was just the same. At length the night of the
third Thursday came, and now he was to complete the charm. There was a
howling wind, and the moon was covered with thick dark clouds, when the
farmer brought the creature to the cross-roads at dead of night. Then he
set it up as before, but he thought, "If I was now to smash it into a
thousand pieces, and then go home and set hard at work, I need not then
do anything wicked."</p>

<p>Presently, however, he reflected: "But I am so miserably poor, and this
will make me rich. Let it go as it may, I can't be worse off than I am
now."</p>

<p>He looked fearfully round him, turned towards the creature trembling,
let three drops of blood fall on it from his finger, and repeated the
magic words which the old man had taught him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the moon emerged from the clouds and shone upon the place where
the farmer was standing before the figure. But the farmer stood
petrified<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span> with terror when he saw the creature come to life. The
spectre rolled his eyes horribly, turned slowly round, and when he saw
his master again, he asked in a grating voice, "What do you want of me?"</p>

<p>But the farmer was almost beside himself with fear, and could not
answer. He rushed away in deadly terror, not caring whither. But the
creature ran after him, clattering and puffing, crying out all the time,
"Why did you bring me to life if you desert me now?"</p>

<p>But the farmer ran on, without daring to look round.</p>

<p>Then the creature grasped his shoulder from behind with his wooden hand,
and screamed out, "You have broken your compact by running away. You
have sold your soul to the devil without gaining the least advantage for
yourself. You have set me free. I am no longer your servant, but will be
your tormenting demon, and will persecute you to your dying hour."</p>

<p>The farmer rushed madly to his house, but the creature followed him,
invisible to every one else.</p>

<p>From this hour everything went wrong with the farmer which he undertook.
His land produced nothing but weeds, his cattle all died, his sheds
fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> in, and if he took anything up, it broke in his hand. Neither man
nor maid would work in his house, and at last all the people held aloof
from him, as from an evil spirit who brought misfortune wherever he
appeared.</p>

<p>Autumn came, and the farmer looked like a shadow, when one day he met
old Michel, who saluted him, and looked scoffingly in his face.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's you," cried the farmer angrily. "It is good that I have met
you, you hell-hound. Where are all your fine promises of wealth and good
luck? I have sold myself to the devil, and I find a hell on earth
already. But all this is your doing!"</p>

<p>"Quiet, quiet!" said the old man. "Who told you to meddle with evil
things if you had not courage? I gave you fair warning. But you showed
yourself a coward at the last moment, and released the creature from
your service. If you had not done this, you might have become a rich and
prosperous man, as I promised you."</p>

<p>"But you never saw the horrible face of the creature when he came to
life," said the farmer in anguish. "Oh, what a fool I was to allow
myself to be tempted by you!"</p>

<p>"I did not tempt you; I only told you what I knew."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>"Help me now."</p>

<p>"Help yourself, for I can't. Haven't I more reason to complain of you
than you of me? I have not deceived you; but where is my reward, and the
fine life you promised me? You are the deceiver."</p>

<p>"All right! all right! Only tell me how I can save myself, and advise me
what to do. I will perform everything."</p>

<p>"No," said the old man, "I have no further advice to give you. I am
still a beggar, and it is all your fault;" and he turned round and left
him.</p>

<p>"Curse upon you!" cried the farmer, whose last hope had vanished.</p>

<p>"But can't I save myself in any way?" said he to himself. "This creature
who sits with the Devil on my neck is after all nothing but my own work,
a thing of wood and potsherds. I must needs be able to destroy him, if I
set about it right."</p>

<p>He ran to his house, where he now lived quite alone. There stood the
creature in a corner, grinning, and asking, "Where's my dinner?"</p>

<p>"What shall I give you to get rid of you?"</p>

<p>"Where's my dinner? Get my dinner, quick. I'm hungry."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wait a little; you shall have it presently."</p>

<p>Then the farmer took up a pine-faggot which was burning in the stove, as
if pondering and then ran out, and locked all the doors on the outside.</p>

<p>It was a cold autumn night. The wind whistled through the neighbouring
pine forest with a strange sighing sound.</p>

<p>"Now you may burn and roast, you spirit of hell!" cried the farmer, and
cast the fire on the thatch. Presently the whole house was wrapped in
bright flames.</p>

<p>Then the farmer laughed madly, and kept on calling out, "Burn and
roast!"</p>

<p>The light of the fire roused the people of the village, and they crowded
round the ill-starred spot. They wished to put out the fire and save the
house, but the farmer pushed them back, saying, "Let it be. What does
the house matter, if he only perishes? He has tormented me long enough,
and I will plague him now, and all may yet be well with me."</p>

<p>The people stared at him in amazement as he spoke. But now the house
fell in crashing, and the farmer shouted, "Now he's burnt!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span></p>

<p>At this moment the creature, visible only to the farmer, rose unhurt
from the smoking ruins with a threatening gesture. As soon as the farmer
saw him, he fell on the ground with a loud shriek.</p>

<p>"What do you see?" asked old Michel, who had just arrived on the scene,
and stood by smiling.</p>

<p>But the farmer returned no answer. He had died of terror.</p>

<h2>THE WOODEN MAN AND THE BIRCH-BARK MAID.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>This is another story which relates how a stingy farmer starved all his
servants, till no one would live with him. He applied to a sorcerer, who
directed him to take a black hare in a bag to a cross-road for three
Thursdays running, just before midnight, and whistle for the Devil. The
farmer took a black cat instead, and on the third Thursday agreed with
the Devil to receive a man-servant and a maid, who should work for him
for twice seven years, and who would require no food, nothing but a
little water. To ratify the bargain, the farmer gave the Devil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span> three
drops of blood from his index-finger. At the end of the time the
servants disappeared, and the farmer could only find a rotten stump and
a heap of birch-bark, as their names signified (Puul&auml;ne and Tohtl&auml;ne).
Then the Devil seized the farmer by the throat and strangled him, and
his wife could find no trace of him but three drops of blood, while all
the corn-bins were empty, and the money-chest contained only withered
birch-leaves.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>A farmer who had unthinkingly devoted his lazy horse to the Devil, was
much annoyed by three, who appeared successively, and demanded it. At
last he was obliged to invite them to his Christmas-dinner, and to
promise to feed them on blood, flesh, and corn. But a Finnish sorcerer
taught him a charm by which he transformed them respectively into a bug,
a wolf, and a rat.</p>

<h2>THE COMPASSIONATE SHOEMAKER.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>Once upon a time, when God himself was still on earth, it happened that
he went to a farm-house disguised as a beggar,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> while a christening
was going forward, and asked for a lodging. But the people did not
receive him, and declared that he might easily be trodden under the feet
of the guests in the confusion. The poor man offered to creep under the
stove, and lie still there; but they would not heed his prayer, and
showed him the door, telling him he might go to the mud hovel, or
where-ever he liked.</p>

<p>In the hovel lived a shoemaker, who was always very compassionate
towards the poor and needy, and would rather suffer hunger himself than
allow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> a poor man to leave his threshold unrelieved. God went to him,
and begged for a night's lodging. The shoemaker gave him a friendly
reception and something to eat, and offered him his own bed, while he
himself lay on straw.</p>

<p>Next morning, when God took his departure, he thanked his host, and
said, "I am he who has power to fulfil whatsoever the heart can desire.
You have given me a friendly and most hospitable reception and I am
grateful to you from my heart, and will reward you. Speak a wish, and it
shall be fulfilled."</p>

<p>The shoemaker answered, "Then I will wish that whenever a poor man comes
to ask my aid, I may be able to give him what he most requires, and that
I myself may never want for daily bread as long as I live."</p>

<p>"Let it be so!" answered God, who took leave of him and departed.</p>

<p>Meantime the people in the farmhouse were feasting and drinking, not
remembering the proverbs, "A large piece strains the mouth," and "The
mouth is the measure of the stomach." They set the house on fire by
their recklessness, and only escaped with bare life. All their goods and
chattels were reduced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span> to ashes, and they were left without a roof to
shelter them. The guests hastened home, but the farmer and his people
were forced to take refuge in the shoemaker's hut. He received them in
the most friendly way, and gave them clothes and shoes, and food and
drink, and saw to it that they wanted for nothing till they could again
provide themselves with shelter.</p>

<p>Besides this, needy people came every day to the shoemaker, and each
received an abundant allowance.</p>

<p>As he thus doled out everything, and refused no one relief, low people
jeered at him, saying, "What is your object in giving everything away?
You cannot make the world warm." He answered, "We should love our
neighbours as ourselves."</p>

<p>At length the shoemaker felt that his last hour had come. So he dressed
himself neatly, took with him a staff of juniper, and set off on the way
to hell. The warden trembled when he saw him, and cried out, "Throw down
the staff! No one may bring such a weapon to hell." The shoemaker took
no heed of this speech, but pressed on his way. At length the Prince of
Hell himself met him, and cried out, "Throw down your staff and let us
wrestle. If you overcome me, I will be your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span> slave; but if I should
overcome you, then you must serve me."</p>

<p>This did not please the shoemaker, who answered, "I will not wrestle
with you, for you have such very clumsy hands, but come against me with
a spear."</p>

<p>As the Devil continued talking, and again advised him to throw away the
staff, the shoemaker struck him a heavy blow with it behind the ear.
Upon this, all hell shook, and the Devil and his companions vanished
suddenly, as lead sinks in water.</p>

<p>Then the shoemaker proceeded farther, and cautiously explored the
interior of the underworld. In one hall lay a great book, in which the
souls of all children who died unbaptized were recorded. Near the book
lay many keys, which opened the rooms in which the children's souls were
imprisoned. So he took the keys, released the innocent captive souls,
and went with them to heaven, where he was received with honour, and a
thanksgiving feast was instituted in remembrance of his good deed.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Among other stories of devils is one of a forester who gave the Devil
three drops of blood for a magic powder which would heal all wounds. But
when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> he died, his corpse rushed out at the door, and was never seen
again. Another time, a dull schoolboy, who was always beaten by his
master, met the Devil, who drew blood from three punctures, and wrote a
compact with it; but the boy was rescued by a clever student, who
afterwards died from the bursting of the "blood-vessel of wisdom," as
was ascertained by autopsy.</p>

<p>The Devil is sometimes represented as driving about in a coach drawn by
twelve black stallions, and annoying the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Another time, a charitable orphan-girl stayed late one Saturday evening
in the bath-house,<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> after washing the poor and helpless, when the
Devil and his mother and three sons drove up in a coach drawn by four
black stallions, with harness adorned with gold and silver, and asked
her hand for one of his sons. But the maiden fled back into the
bath-house, after making the sign of the cross on the threshold, and
replied that she was not ready, as she had no shoes nor dress. The Devil
desired her to ask for whatever she wanted; but a mouse called to her to
ask for each article separately.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span> One of the sons fetched each article
as it was asked for; and the maiden was at last fully attired, when the
cock crew, and everything vanished. Next day the girl's mistress and her
daughter were envious of her fine clothes and ornaments; and next
Saturday evening the daughter went to the bath-house. But she despised
the warning of the mouse, and asked for everything at once, when she was
taken into the coach and carried away.</p>

<p>Tales of minor dealings with the Devil are common. A farmer taking flax
to market, invoked the Devil to enable him to sell it well. The Devil
did so, and rode home with him from market, made him drunk, and tempted
him to commit a burglary at the house of a rich man in the
neighbourhood. He put his hat on the farmer's head, which made him
invisible, and broke open the iron bars of the door with his teeth. On
the way home, the farmer cried out, while crossing the ford where he had
first met the Devil, "Good God! how much money I've got!" The Devil
vanished, and all the treasure fell into the stream, and was lost. On
another occasion, a labourer devoted his horse to the Devil, at a time
when an old Devil and his son overheard him. The son wanted to lay claim
to it, but his father warned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> him that it was no use, for such people
did not mean what they said, and did not keep their word. Nevertheless,
the imp went to unharness it, and the peasant in terror invoked the
Trinity, when the imp ran away, and his father laughed at him.</p>

<p>The stories which follow, like several of the preceding, are mostly told
by Jannsen, and deal with various forms of black magic. The first is an
instance of something very like Vampyrism.</p>

<h2>MARTIN AND HIS DEAD MASTER.</h2>


<p>Martin was a young fellow who was very fond of amusing himself with the
girls, and often sat up talking and joking with them till very late in
the evening. One Sunday, when he had slept very little the night before,
he went to church, and there he fell asleep and did not awake till dark
night. He rubbed his eyes, and could not imagine where he was, for the
church was full of people, and they were all fine gentlemen. Martin
looked about, and recognised among them his former master, who had been
buried three months before. He also knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span> him, and asked, "Well, Martin,
when did you die?" "Three months after you were buried," answered
Martin. "Oh, indeed," said the gentleman; "but what do you think?
Shouldn't we go home now for a short visit? Won't you accompany me?"
"I'm ready," said Martin, and he rose and followed his master. On the
way he found a frozen glove, which he put in his pocket. They came to
the mansion, and the master went first to the stable, for he intended to
torment the horses, and thought Martin would help him. When the
gentleman entered, the horses made no sound, but when Martin came in,
they neighed. The master turned round and said, "Listen, Martin! you
can't be really dead. Give me your hand to feel." Martin thrust his hand
into the frozen glove which he had found on the road, and extended it to
his master, who said, "Yes, you are really dead; your hand is shockingly
cold." Then he tormented the horses till they were covered with white
foam. Martin was sorry, but could do nothing but stand and look on. At
last the master ceased his spiteful work, and said, "Let us go into the
house. Go you into the kitchen and frighten the maids, and I will
torment the lady. When it is time to depart, I will come for you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span> The
lady screamed and sobbed with terror as if she was mad, and the maids
screamed too, but with fun and frolic.</p>

<p>After a long time, the master came to the kitchen, and said, "Come,
Martin, let us make haste, for the cocks will soon crow." He would have
liked to have run away, but he was too much afraid, so he went with his
master. On the way his master talked a great deal to him about how his
wife had searched everywhere for the treasure which he had hidden before
his death, and what she had done to banish the nightly hauntings, but
everything was useless. "Yes," said Martin, "it must be a great sorcerer
who can lay spectres and discover treasures in the ground. Perhaps she
will never meet with one."</p>

<p>"Ha! ha!" laughed the gentleman, "no great cleverness is needed. If a
living person was to stamp three times on my grave with his left heel,
and say each time, 'Here shall you lie,' I couldn't get out again. But
the money which I hid in my lifetime is under the floor of my bedroom,
near the stove."</p>

<p>Martin was delighted to hear this, and would have shouted for joy, but
he thought it too dangerous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span> They now came to the churchyard, and the
gentleman asked Martin to show him his grave. But Martin said, "We shall
have another opportunity, I'm afraid the cocks are just about to crow."
The gentleman slipped quickly into his grave, when Martin stamped three
times with his left heel on the mound, and said three times, "Here shall
you lie."</p>

<p>"Oh, you liar and scoundrel!" cried the dead man from the grave; "if I
had known that you were still alive, I should have crushed and mangled
you. Now I can do nothing more to you."</p>

<p>Then Martin returned home full of joy, and told the lady all that he had
seen and heard and done. The lady did not know how to thank him enough.
She took him as her husband, and they lived together happily and
honourably; and if they could have got on as well with Death as with the
nocturnal spectre, they might be living still.</p>

<p>Free-shooters, so well known in Germany, are not unknown in Esthonia. In
the story of the "Hunter's Lost Luck" (Kreutzwald), we find a hunter
whose usual skill had deserted him selling himself to the Devil with
three drops of blood for a magic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span> bullet which should kill the author of
his bad luck. His good luck depended on his not shooting at the leader
of a flock or herd; but one evening, having drunk too much, he fired at
the leader of a troop of foxes, and fell down dead. The villagers took
his body home; but when he was put into the coffin, a great black cat,
which was supposed to be the Old Boy himself, carried him away.</p>

<p>The story of "The Coiners of Leal" relates to the ruins of an old

young nobleman set out to explore it, and was warned off by a tall man
in black clothes, but, on advancing, sank into the vaults, where he
found a number of men coining gold and silver. They bound him by an oath
of secrecy as to their proceedings, warning him that if he broke it,
their master, the dog, would fetch him, and make him coin gold and
silver for ever with them; and he received a sackful of treasure to
remind him of his oath. Some years after, he drank too much at a feast,
told his story, and immediately disappeared, and was never seen again.</p>

<h2>THE BEWITCHED HORSE.</h2>


<p>A farmer's old horse had died, so he skinned it, and threw it behind the
threshing-floor, intending to bury it next day. He saw a great toad
creep under it as he went away. At night he went into the barn to sleep,
and hearing a noise outside, kept watch for thieves; but, to his horror,
he saw the door slowly open, and his dead horse enter. The horse came in
snuffling and snorting, and broke down several of the posts that
supported the loft where his master had been sleeping; but the farmer
contrived to scramble into the rafters. At last the cock crew, when the
horse fell down like a lump of meat, and the farmer too lost his hold
and fell upon him. Next morning the farmer buried the horse, and stamped
three times with his left heel on the grave; so the horse remained
quiet.</p>

<p>But it was a sorcerer who had a grudge against the farmer who had sent
the toad into the carcass of the horse.</p>

<h2>SECTION IX</h2>

<h3><i>HIDDEN TREASURES</i></h3>


<p>In Esthonia, as elsewhere, we meet with many stories of hidden
treasures, frequently in connection with devils, and hence we place this
section next to the Devil-stories. The stories of "The Courageous
Barn-keeper" and of the "Gallows Dwarfs" are curious and interesting;
those which follow are given here only in abstract. In all countries
which have been devastated by war, traditions of hidden treasure are
common. I remember once reading a story in a newspaper (but I do not
know if the report was true) of a quantity of coins of Edward the
Confessor and Harold being dug up in a field respecting which there was
a tradition in the neighbourhood that a great treasure was concealed in
it. In Esthonian as well as in Oriental tales, hidden treasures are
usually under the care of non-human guardians, even when it is not said
that they were specially placed under their protection. This notion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
probably persists in many countries to the present day. It is said that
when Kidd, the famous pirate, buried a hoard of treasure, he used to
slaughter a negro at the place, that the ghost might guard it. Stories
of his hidden treasure (more or less probable) are still rife in
America.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE COURAGEOUS BARN-KEEPER.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>Once upon a time there lived a barn-keeper who had few to equal him in
courage. The Old Boy himself admitted that a bolder man had never yet
appeared on earth. In the evening, when the threshers were no longer at
work in the barn, he often paid a visit to the barn-keeper, and never
tired of talking with him. He was under the impression that the
barn-keeper did not recognise him, and supposed him to be only an
ordinary peasant; but his host knew him well enough, though he pretended
not, and had made up his mind to box Old Hornie's ears if he could. One
evening the Old Boy began to complain of the hard life of a bachelor,
and how he had nobody to knit him a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span> pair of stockings or to hem a
handkerchief. The barn-keeper answered, "Why don't you go a-wooing, my
brother?" The Old Boy returned, "I've tried my luck often enough, but
the girls won't have me. The younger and prettier they are, the more
they laugh at me."</p>

<p>The barn-keeper advised him to court old maids or widows, who would be
much easier to win, and who would not be so likely to despise a suitor.
The Old Boy took his advice, and some weeks afterwards married an old
maid; but it was not long before he came back to the barn-keeper to
complain of his troubles. His newly-married wife was full of tricks; she
left him no rest night or day, and tormented him continually. "What sort
of a man are you," laughed the barn-keeper, "to allow your wife to wear
the trousers? If you marry a wife, you must take care to be master." The
Old Boy answered, "I couldn't manage her. If she chose to bring anybody
else into the house, I couldn't venture to set foot in it." The
barn-keeper sought to comfort him, and advised him to try his luck
elsewhere; but the Old Boy thought that the first trial was enough, and
had no inclination to put his neck under a woman's yoke again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>In the autumn of the following year, when threshing had begun again, the
old acquaintance of the barn-keeper paid him another visit. The latter
saw that the peasant had something on his mind, but he asked no
questions, thinking it best to wait till the other broached the matter
himself. He had not long to wait before he heard all the old fellow's
misfortunes. During the summer he had made the acquaintance of a young
widow who cooed like a dove, so that the little man again thought of
courtship. In short, he married her, but discovered afterwards that she
was a shocking scold at home, who would gladly have scratched his eyes
out of his head, and he had cause to thank his stars that he had escaped
from her hands. The barn-keeper remarked, "I see you're good for nothing
as a husband, for you are chicken-hearted, and don't know how to manage
a wife." The Old Boy was forced to acknowledge that it was true. After
they had talked awhile about women and marriage, the Old Boy said, "If
you are really such a bold man as you pretend, and could tame the most
hellish<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> woman that exists, I will show you a way by which you can
turn your courage to better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> account than by subduing a violent woman.
Do you know the ruins of the old castle on the mountain? A great
treasure lies there since ancient times, which no one has been able to
get at, just because nobody has had enough courage to dig it up." The
barn-keeper said, smiling, "If nothing more is needed than courage, the
treasure is already as good as in my pocket." Then the Old Boy told him
that he must go to dig up the treasure next Thursday night, when the
moon would be full; but added, "Take good care that you are not a bit
afraid, for if your heart fails you, or if only a muscle of your body
trembles, you will not only lose the expected treasure, but may even
lose your life, like many others who have tried their luck before you.
If you don't believe me, you may go into any farmhouse, and the people
will tell you what they have heard about the walls of the old castle.
Many people even profess to have seen something with their own eyes. But
once more, if you value your life, and wish to possess the treasure,
beware of all fear."</p>

<p>On the morning of the appointed Thursday, the barn-keeper set out, and
although he did not feel the slightest fear, he turned into the village
inn,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span> hoping to find somebody there who could give him some kind of
information about the ruins of the old castle. He asked the landlord
what the old ruins on the hill were, and whether people knew anything
about who built them, and who destroyed them. An old farmer, who
overheard the question, gave him the following information: "The report
goes that a very rich squire lived there many centuries ago, who was
lord over vast territories and a great population. This lord ruled with
an iron hand, and treated his subjects with great severity, but he had
amassed vast wealth by their sweat and blood, and gold and silver poured
into his castle on all sides in hogsheads. Here he stored his wealth in
deep cellars, where it was secure from thieves and robbers. No one knows
how the wealthy miscreant came to his end. One morning the attendants
found his bed empty and three drops of blood on the floor. A great black
cat, which was never seen before or afterwards, was sitting on the
canopy of the bed. It is supposed that this cat was the Evil Spirit<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>
himself, who had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span> strangled the squire in his bed in this form, and had
then carried him off to P&otilde;rgu to expiate his crimes. As soon as the
relatives of the squire heard of his death, they wished to secure his
treasures, but not a single copeck was to be found. It was at first
thought that the servants had stolen it, and they were brought to trial;
but as they knew that they were innocent, nothing could be extracted
from them, even under the torture. In the meantime, many people heard a
chinking like money deep under ground at night, and informed the
authorities; and as this was investigated and the report confirmed, the
servants were set at liberty. The strange nocturnal chinking was often
heard afterwards, and many people dug for the treasure, but nothing was
discovered, and no one returned from the caverns under the castle, for
they were doubtless seized upon by the same power which had brought the
owner of the money to such a dreadful end. Every one saw that there was
something uncanny about it, and no one dared to live in the old castle.
At length the roof and walls fell in from long exposure to rain and
wind, and nothing was left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> but an old ruin. No one dares to spend the
night near it, and still less would any one be rash enough to seek for
the ancient treasure there." So said the old farmer.</p>

<p>When the barn-keeper had heard the story, he said, half joking, "I
should like to try my luck. Who'll go with me to-morrow night?" The men
made the sign of the cross, and declared that their lives were more to
them than all the treasures in the world, and that no one could reach
these treasures without losing his soul. Then they begged the stranger
to recall his words, and not to pledge himself to the Evil One. But the
bold barn-keeper gave no heed to their entreaties and expostulations,
and resolved to attempt the adventure alone. In the evening he asked the
host for a bundle of pine-splinters, that he might not be in the dark,
and then inquired the nearest way to the ruins.</p>

<p>One of the peasants, who seemed to be a little bolder than the others,
went with him for some distance as his guide with a lighted lantern. As
the sky was cloudy, and it was quite dark, the barn-keeper was obliged
to grope his way. The whistling of the wind and the screeching of the
owls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span> were terrible to hear, but could not frighten his bold heart. As
soon as he was able to strike a light under the shelter of the masonry,
he lit a splinter and looked about for a door or an opening through
which he could get down underground. After looking about fruitlessly for
some time, at last he discovered a hole at the foot of the wall, which
seemed to lead downwards. He put the burning splinter in a crack in the
wall, and cleared out so much earth and rubbish with his hands that he
could creep through. After he had gone some distance, he came to a
flight of stone stairs, and there was now room enough for him to stand
upright. He descended the stairs with his bundle of splinters on his
shoulder and one burning in his hand, and at last reached an iron door,
which was not locked. He pushed the heavy door open, and was about to
enter, when a large black cat with fiery eyes dashed through the door
like the wind and rushed up the stairs. The barn-keeper thought, "That
must be what strangled the lord of the castle;" so he pushed the door
to, threw down the bundle of splinters, and then examined the place more
carefully. It was a great wide hall, with doors everywhere in the walls;
he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> counted twelve, and considered which he should try first. "Seven's a
lucky number," said he, so he counted till he came to the seventh door,
but it was locked, and would not yield. But when he pushed at the door
with all his strength, the rusty lock gave way and the door flew open.
When the barn-keeper entered, he found a room of moderate size; on one
side stood a table and bench, and at the opposite wall was a stove, with
a bundle of faggots lying on the ground near the hearth. The inspector
then lit a fire, and by its light he found a small pot and a cup of
flour standing on the stove, and some salt in a salt-cellar. "Look
here!" cried the barn-keeper. "Here I find something to eat
unexpectedly; I have some water with me in my flask, and can cook some
warm porridge." So he set the pot on the fire, put some flour and water
into it, added some salt, stirred it with a splinter of wood, and boiled
his porridge well, after which he poured it into the cup, and set it on
the table. The bright fire lit up the room, and he did not need to light
a splinter. The bold barn-keeper seated himself at the table, took the
spoon, and began to eat the warm porridge. All at once he looked up and
saw the black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> cat with the fiery eyes sitting on the stove. He could
not comprehend how the beast had come there, as he had seen it running
up the stairs with his own eyes. After this, three loud knocks were
struck on the door, till the walls and floor shook. The barn-keeper did
not lose his presence of mind, but cried out loudly, "Let anybody enter
who has a head on his shoulders!" Immediately the door flew wide open,
and the black cat sprang from the stove and darted through, while sparks
of fire flew from its eyes and mouth. As soon as the cat had
disappeared, four tall men entered, clad in long white coats, and
wearing caps of flame-colour, which shone so brightly that the room
became as bright as day. The men carried a bier on their shoulders, and
a coffin stood upon it, but still the bold barn-keeper did not feel the
least bit afraid. The men set the coffin on the ground without speaking
a word, and then one after another went out at the door, and closed it
behind them. The cat whined and scratched at the door, as if it wanted
to get in, but the barn-keeper did not concern himself, and only ate his
warm porridge. When he had eaten enough, he stood up, and looked at the
coffin. He broke open the lid, and beneath it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> he beheld a little man
with a long white beard. The barn-keeper lifted him out, and carried him
to the fire to warm him. It was not long before the little old man began
to revive, and to move his hands and feet. The bold barn-keeper was not
a bit afraid; he took the porridge-pot and the spoon from the table, and
began to feed the old man. The latter said presently, "Thank you, my
son, for taking pity on such a poor creature as I am, and reviving my
body, which was stiff with cold and hunger. I will give you such a
princely reward for your good deed that you shall not forget me as long
as you live. Behind the stove you will find some pitch-torches, light
one and come with me. But first make the door securely fast, that the
furious cat may not get in to break your neck. We will afterwards make
it so tame that it cannot hurt anybody again."</p>

<p>As he spoke, the old man raised a square trap-door about three feet
broad from the floor, and it was plain that the stone covered the
entrance to a cellar. The old man went down the steps first, and the
barn-keeper followed him with the torch till they reached a terribly
deep cavern.</p>

<p>In this great cellar-like arched cavern lay an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> enormous heap of money,
as big as the largest haycock, half silver and half gold. The little old
man took from a cupboard in the wall a handful of wax-candles, three
bottles of wine, a smoked ham, and a loaf of bread. Then he said to the
barn-keeper, "I give you three days' time to count and sort this heap.
You must divide the heap into two equal parts, exactly alike, and so
that nothing remains over. While you are busy with this, I will lie down
by the wall to sleep, but take care not to make the least mistake or
I'll strangle you."</p>

<p>The barn-keeper at once set to work, and the old man lay down. In order
to guard against any mistake, the barn-keeper always took two similar
coins to divide, whether thalers or roubles, gold or silver, and he laid
one on his right, and the other on his left, to form two heaps. When he
found his strength failing, he took a pull at one of the bottles, ate
some bread and meat, and then set to work with renewed strength. As he
only allowed himself a short sleep at night, in order to get on with his
work, he had already finished the sorting on the evening of the second
day, but one small piece of silver remained over. What was to be done?
This did not trouble the bold barn-keeper; he drew his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span> knife from his
pocket, laid the blade on the middle of the coin, and struck the back of
the knife so hard with a stone that the coin was split in two halves.
One half he laid to the right heap, and the other to the left, after
which he roused up the old man, and asked him to inspect the work. When
the old man saw the two halves of the last coin lying on the heap to the
right and left, he uttered a cry of joy, and fell on the neck of the
barn-keeper, stroked his cheeks, and at last exclaimed, "A thousand and
again a thousand thanks to you, brave youth, for releasing me from my
long, long captivity. I have been obliged to watch over my treasure here
for many hundred years, because there was no one who had sufficient
courage or sense to divide the money so that nothing was left over. I
was therefore forced by a binding oath to strangle one after another,
and as no one returned, for the last two hundred years no one has dared
to come here, though there was not a night which I allowed to pass
without jingling the money. But it was destined for you, O child of good
luck! to become my deliverer, after I had almost abandoned all hope, and
fancied myself doomed to eternal imprisonment. Thanks, a thousand
thanks, for your good deed!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> Take now one of these heaps of money as the
reward for your trouble, but the other you must divide among the poor,
as an atonement for my grievous sins; for when I lived on earth in this
castle I was a great libertine and scoundrel. You have still to
accomplish one task for my benefit, and for your own. When you go
upstairs again, and you meet the great black cat on the stairs, seize it
and hang it up. Here is a noose from which it cannot escape again."</p>

<p>Hereupon he took from his bosom a chain woven of fine gold thread, as
thick as a shoe-string, which he handed to the barn-keeper, and then
vanished, as if he had sunk into the ground. A tremendous crash
followed, as if the earth had cloven asunder beneath the barn-keeper's
feet. The light went out, and he found himself in thick darkness, but
even this unexpected event did not shake his courage. He contrived to
grope his way till he came to the stairs, which he ascended till he
reached the first room, where he had boiled his porridge. The fire in
the hearth had long been extinguished, but he found some sparks among
the ashes, which he succeeded in blowing into a flame. The coffin was
still standing on the ground, but instead of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span> the old man, the great
black cat was sleeping in it. The barn-keeper seized it by the head,
slipped the gold chain round its neck, hung it on a strong iron nail in
the wall, and then laid down on the floor to rest.</p>

<p>Next morning he made his way out of the ruins, and took the nearest path
to the inn from whence he had started. When the host saw that the
stranger had escaped unhurt, his joy and astonishment knew no bounds.
But the barn-keeper said, "Get me a few dozen sacks to hold a ton, for
which I will pay well, and hire horses, so that I can fetch away my
treasure." Then the host perceived that the stranger's expedition had
not been fruitless, and he immediately fulfilled the rich man's orders.</p>

<p>When the barn-keeper learned from the people what part of the old man's
domains was formerly under the authority of the lord of the castle, he
assigned one-third of the money destined for the poor to this district,
handed over the remaining two-thirds to the local authorities for
distribution, and settled himself with his own money in a distant

<h2>THE GALLOWS-DWARFS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>

<p>Once upon a time a parson was looking out for a servant who would
undertake to toll the church bell at midnight in addition to his other
duties. Many men had already made the attempt, but whenever they went to
toll the bell at night, they disappeared as suddenly as if they had sunk
into the ground, for the bell was not heard to toll, and the bell-ringer
never came back. The parson kept the matter as quiet as possible, but
the sudden disappearance of so many men could not be concealed, and he
could no longer find anybody willing to enter his service.</p>

<p>The more the matter was talked about, the more seriously it was
discussed, and there were even malicious tongues to whisper that the
parson himself murdered his servants. Every Sunday the parson proclaimed
from the pulpit after the sermon, "I am in want of a good servant, and
offer double<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span> wages, good keep," &amp;c.; but for many months no one applied
for the post. However, one day the crafty Hans<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> offered his services.
He had been last in the employment of a stingy master, and the offer of
good keep was therefore very attractive to him, and he was quite ready
to enter on his duties at once. "Very well, my son," said the parson,
"if you are armed with courage and trust in God, you may make your first
trial to-night, and we will conclude our bargain to-morrow."</p>

<p>Hans was quite content, and went into the servants' room without
troubling his head about his new employment. The parson was a miser, and
was always vexed when his servants ate too much, and generally came into
the room during their meals, hoping that they would eat less in his
presence. He also encouraged them to drink as much as possible, thinking
that the more they drank, the less they would be able to eat. But Hans
was more cunning than his master, for he emptied the jug at one draught,
saying, "That makes twice as much room for the food." The parson thought
this was really the case, and no longer urged his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span> people to drink,
while Hans laughed in his sleeve at the success of his trick.</p>

<p>It was about eleven o'clock at night when Hans entered the church. He
found the interior lighted up, and was rather surprised when he saw a
numerous company, who were not assembled for purposes of devotion. The
people were sitting at a long table playing cards. But Hans was not a
bit frightened, or, if he secretly felt a little alarm, he was cunning
enough to show nothing of it. He went straight to the table and sat down
with the players. One of them noticed him, and said, "Friend, what
business have you here?" Hans gave him a good stare, and presently
answered, "It would be better for a meddler like you to hold his tongue.
If anybody here has a right to ask questions, I think I'm the man. But
if I don't care to avail myself of my right, I certainly think it would
be more polite of you to hold your jaw." Hans then took up the cards,
and began to play with the strangers as if they were his best friends.
He had good luck, for he doubled his stakes, and emptied the pockets of
many of the other players. Presently the cock crew. Midnight must have
come; and in a moment the lights were extinguished,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span> and the players,
with their table and benches, vanished. Hans groped about in the dark
church for some time before he could find the door which led to the
belfry.</p>

<p>When Hans had nearly reached the top of the first flight, he saw a
little man without a head sitting on the top step. "Oho, my little
fellow! what do you want here?" cried Hans, and, without waiting for an
answer, he gave him a good kick and sent him rolling down the long
flight of stairs. He found the same kind of little sentinel posted on
the top stair of the second, third, and fourth flights, and pitched them
down one after another, so that all the bones in their bodies rattled.</p>

<p>At last Hans reached the bell without further hindrance. When he looked
up, to make sure that all was right, he saw another headless little man
sitting crouched together in the bell. He had loosened the clapper, and
seemed to be waiting for Hans to pull the bell-rope, to drop the heavy
clapper on his head, which would certainly have killed him. "Wait a
while, my little friend," cried Hans; "we haven't bargained for this.
You may have seen how I rolled your little comrades downstairs without
tiring their own legs! You your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>self shall follow them. But because you
sit the highest, you shall make the proudest journey. I'll pitch you out
of the loophole, so that you'll have no wish to come back again."</p>

<p>As he spoke, he raised the ladder, intending to drag the little man out
of the bell and fulfil his threat. The dwarf saw his danger, and began
to beg, "Dear brother, spare my wretched life, and I promise that
neither my brothers nor I will again interfere with the bellringer at
night. I may seem small and contemptible, but who knows whether I may
not some day be able to do more for your welfare than offer you a
beggar's thanks?"</p>

<p>"Poor little fellow!" laughed Hans. "Your ransom wouldn't be worth a
gnat. But as I'm in a good humour just now, I'm willing to spare your
life. But take care not to come in my way again, for I might not be
inclined to trifle with you another time."</p>

<p>The headless dwarf gave him his humble thanks, clambered down the
bell-rope like a squirrel, and bolted down the belfry-stairs as if he
was on fire, while Hans tolled the bell to his heart's content.</p>

<p>When the parson heard the bell tolling at midnight he was surprised and
pleased at having at last found a servant who had withstood the ordeal.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>After Hans had finished his work he went into the hayloft, and lay down
to sleep.</p>

<p>The parson was in the habit of getting up early in the morning, and
going to see whether his people were about their work. All were in their
places except the new servant, and nobody had seen anything of him. When
eleven o'clock came, and Hans still made no appearance, the parson
became anxious, and began to fear that the bell-ringer had met his death
like those before him. But when the rattle was used to call the workmen
to dinner, Hans likewise appeared among them.</p>

<p>"Where have you been all morning?" asked the parson.</p>

<p>"I've been asleep," answered Hans, yawning.</p>

<p>"Asleep?" cried the parson in amazement. "You don't mean that you sleep
every day till this hour?"</p>

<p>"I think," answered Hans, "it's as clear as spring-water. Nobody can
serve two masters. He who works at night must sleep during the day, for
night was meant for labourers to rest. If you relieve me from tolling
the bell at night, I'm quite ready to set to work at daybreak. But if I
have to toll the bell at night, I must sleep in the daytime, at any rate
till mid-day."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>After disputing over the matter for some time, they finally agreed on
the following conditions:&mdash;Hans was to be relieved of his nocturnal
duties, and was to work from sunrise to sunset. He was to be allowed to
sleep for half-an-hour after nine o'clock in the morning, and for a
whole hour after dinner, and was to have the whole of Sunday free.
"But," said the parson, "you might sometimes help with odd jobs at other
times, especially in winter, when the days are short, and the work would
then last longer."</p>

<p>"Not at all," cried Hans, "for that's why the days are longer in summer.
I won't do any more than work from sunrise to sunset on week-days, as I
promised."</p>

<p>Some time afterwards the parson was asked to attend a grand christening
in town. The town was only a few hours from the parsonage, but Hans took
a bag of provisions with him. "What's that for?" said the parson. "We
shall get to town before evening." But Hans answered, "Who can foresee
everything? Many things may happen on the road to interfere with our
journey, and you know that our bargain was that I am only obliged to
serve you till sunset. If the sun sets before we reach town, you'll have
to finish your journey alone."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>They were in the middle of the forest when the sun set. Hans stopped the
horses, took up his provision-bag, and jumped out of the sledge. "What
are you doing, Hans? Are you mad?" asked the pastor of souls. But Hans
answered quietly, "I'm going to sleep here; for the sun has set, and my
time of work is over." His master did his utmost to move him with
alternate threats and entreaties, but it was all of no use, and at last
he promised him a good present and an increase in his wages. "Are you
not ashamed, Mr. Parson?" said Hans. "Would you tempt me to stray from
the right way and break my agreement? All the treasures of the earth
would not induce me, for you hold a man by his word, and an ox by his
horns. If you want to go to town to-night, travel on alone, in God's
name; for I can't go any farther with you, now that my hours of service
have expired."</p>

<p>"But, my good Hans, my dear fellow," said the parson, "I really can't
leave you here all alone by yourself. Don't you see the gallows close
by, with two evil-doers hanging on it, whose souls are now burning in
hell? Surely you wouldn't venture to pass the night in the neighbourhood
of such company?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" said Hans. "These gallows-birds are hanging up in the air,
and I shall sleep on the ground below, so we can't interfere with each
other." As he spoke he turned his back to his master and went off with
his provision-bag.</p>

<p>If the parson would not miss the christening, it was necessary for him
to go to town alone. The people were much astonished to see him arrive
without a coachman; but when he had related his astonishing altercation
with Hans, they could not make up their minds whether the master or the
servant was the biggest fool of the two.</p>

<p>Hans cared nothing about what the people thought or said of him. He ate
his supper, lit himself a pipe to warm his nose, made himself a bed
under a great branching pine-tree, wrapped himself in his warm rug, and
went to sleep. He might have slept for some hours when he was roused by
a sudden noise. It was a bright moonlight night, and close by stood two
headless dwarfs under the pine-tree exchanging angry words. Hans raised
himself to look at them better, when they both cried out at once, "It is
he! it is he!" One of them drew nearer to Hans' sleeping place and said,
"Old friend, we have met again by a lucky chance. My bones still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span> ache
from the steps in the church tower, and I dare say you haven't forgotten
the story. We'll deal with your bones now in such a fashion that you
won't forget our meeting for weeks. Hi! there, comrades; come on and set
to work!"</p>

<p>Upon this a crowd of the headless dwarfs rushed together from all sides
like a swarm of gnats. They were all armed with thick cudgels, bigger
than themselves. The number of these little enemies threatened danger,
for they struck as hard as any strong man could have done. Hans thought
his last hour was come, for he could not make any defence against such a
host of enemies. But by good luck another dwarf made his appearance,
just as the blows were falling fastest. "Stop, stop, comrades!" he
exclaimed. "This man has been my benefactor, and I owe him a debt of
gratitude. He gave me my life when I was in his power. Although he
pitched some of you downstairs, he didn't cripple any of you. The warm
bath cured your broken limbs long ago, and you had better forgive him
and go home."</p>

<p>The headless dwarfs were easily persuaded by their comrade, and went
quietly away. Hans now recognised his deliverer as the apparition who
had sat in the church-bell at night. The dwarf sat down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> with Hans under
the pine-tree, and said, "You laughed at me once when I said that a time
might come in which I might be useful to you. That time has now arrived,
and let it teach you not to despise even the smallest creature in the
world." "I thank you with all my heart," returned Hans. "My bones are
almost pulverised with their blows, and I should hardly have escaped
with life if you had not arrived in the very nick of time."</p>

<p>The headless dwarf continued, "My debt is now paid, but I will do more,
and give you something to indemnify you for your thrashing. You need no
longer toil in the service of a stingy parson. When you reach home
to-morrow go straight to the north corner of the church, where you will
find a great stone fixed in the wall, which is not secured with mortar
like the others. It is full moon on the night of the day after
to-morrow. Go at midnight, and take this stone out of the wall with a
lever. Under the stone you will find an inestimable treasure, which many
generations have heaped together; there are gold and silver church
plate, and a large amount of money, which was once concealed in time of
war. Those who hid the treasure have all died more than a hundred years
ago, and not a living<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> soul knows anything about the matter. You must
divide one-third of the money among the poor of the parish, and all the
rest is yours, to do what you like with." At this moment a cock crew in
a distant village, and the headless dwarf vanished as if he had been
wiped out.</p>

<p>Hans could not sleep for a long time for the pain in his limbs, and
thought much of the hidden treasure, but he dropped asleep at last
towards morning.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when his master returned from town.
"Hans," said the parson, "you were a great fool not to go with me
yesterday. Look here! I've had plenty to eat and drink, and got money in
my pocket into the bargain." Meantime he jingled the money to vex him
more. But Hans answered quietly, "Worthy Mister Parson, you have had to
keep awake all night for that bit of money, but I've earned a hundred
times as much in my sleep." "Show me what you earned," cried the parson.
But Hans answered, "Fools jingle their copecks, but wise men hide their
roubles."</p>

<p>When they reached home, Hans did his duty zealously, unharnessed and fed
the horses, and then walked round the church till he found the stone in
the wall that was not mortared.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span></p>

<p>On the first night after the full moon, when everybody else was asleep,
Hans crept quietly out of the house with a pickaxe, wrenched out the
stone with much difficulty, and actually found the hole with the money,
just as the dwarf had described it to him. Next Sunday he divided the
third part among the poor of the parish, and gave notice to the parson
that he was about to quit his service, and as he asked no wages for so
short a time, he got his discharge without any demur. But Hans travelled
a long way off, bought himself a nice farm-house, married a young wife,
and lived quietly and comfortably for many years.</p>

<p>At the time when my grandfather was a shepherd-boy, there were many old
people living in our village who had known Hans, and who bore witness to
the truth of this story.</p>

<h2>THE TREASURE AT KERTELL.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>During a great war, the people of Kertell, in the island of Dag&ouml;, caused
a great iron chest to be made,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span> wherein they stored all their gold and
silver, and sunk it in the river near the old bridge. But they all
perished without recovering it. Many years afterwards, a man who was
passing by in the evening saw a small flame flickering in the air. He
laid his pipe on a stone and followed the flame; but it disappeared, and
on going to pick up his pipe, he found it gone, and money lying on the
stone. But afterwards, whenever he passed the stone, he found money. His
companions advised him to consult a magician with respect to raising the
treasure, of which the tradition had persisted; and the magician
directed him to go to the place where he had seen the flame on three
successive Thursdays, and sacrifice a cock, but not to speak of it to
any one.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> On the third Thursday, he took some companions with him;
and when the cock was sacrificed, the treasure-chest appeared above
water, and they dragged it to shore with great labour. But one of the
party looked towards the bridge, and saw a little boy mounted on a pig
riding over it. He exclaimed to his companions, when the figures
disappeared, the stakes and ropes gave way, and the treasure fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span> back
into the river, and was irrecoverably lost to them.</p>

<h2>THE GOLDEN SNAKES.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>Two woodcutters found a number of snakes in the wood, and one of the men
killed some, and he and his comrade followed them up till they came to a
vast mass of snakes, among which was one with a golden crown. They fled,
but were pursued by the snake-king, when one of them turned round and
hit him on the head with an axe, when he changed into a heap of gold.
They then returned to the cluster of snakes, but they had all
disappeared, and they found only another heap of gold. They divided the
money, and with half of it they built a church.</p>

<h2>THE DEVIL'S TREASURE.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Jannsen</span>.)</h3>


<p>A travelling Swedish shoemaker saw a fire burning one night on the Sand
Mountain, and on reaching the spot, found an iron chest, which he
opened, and finding it to contain a pot of gold, helped himself to a
good supply. He then left his situation, and wandered about till he came
to Ringen, where he was appointed shoemaker to the castle. One evening
he was alone in his room when he heard a horn blown twice, but each time
he went out and found nothing. He then took his prayerbook in his hand,
ate his supper, and went to bed, but was awakened by a tremendous noise
in the castle. On opening his eyes, he saw that his room was lit up with
tapers, and two women, one in a red and the other in a green dress,
stood by his bed, who invited him to dance. Half asleep, he cried out,
"To hell with you! Is this a time to dance?" They reminded him of the
money which he had taken, left the room, and banged the door after
them,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span> so that the whole castle shook. The lights went out, and the
shoemaker turned over and went to sleep again. Next morning he found
himself lying terribly bruised, with his head and body in the hall, and
his legs in the room. On his breast were the impress of two hands,
showing prints of all the fingers. Shortly afterwards he died, having
confessed to the priest, and left all his money for a church-bell. The
chest was found empty, the demons having carried off their treasure
again; but the shoemaker was buried under the pulpit in the church at
Ringen.</p>

<h2>THE NOCTURNAL CHURCH-GOERS.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>.)</h3>


<p>One Christmas Eve the people at a farm-house a couple of versts from a
church went to bed early, intending to go to early morning service by
candle-light. The farmer woke up, and on going out to see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span> how the
weather was, he saw the church lit up, and thinking he had overslept
himself, called his people and they set out. They found the church lit
up and full of people, but the singing sounded rather strange. When they
reached the open door, the lights and people disappeared, and a stranger
came out, who told them to return, saying, "This is our service; yours
begins to-morrow." But he took one youth of the party aside, and told
him to come again at midnight three days before St. John's Eve and he
would make his fortune, but he warned him to keep it secret.</p>

<p>As the party returned to the farm-house, the sky cleared, and they saw
from the position of the stars that it was midnight. When the matter
came to the pastor's ears, he tried to persuade the people that it was
only a dream; but the matter could not be hushed up.</p>

<p>The youth who had received an invitation from the stranger felt very
doubtful about keeping the appointment, especially as he had been
commanded to keep it secret; but a fortnight before the time, he was
going home one evening after sunset, when he saw an old woman sitting by
the roadside, who asked him what he was thinking about so deeply.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span> He
made no answer, and then she asked to see his hand to tell his fortune,
assuring him that she meant him well. She put on her spectacles, and
after examining his hand for some time, promised him great good fortune,
and told him to go with the stranger without fear. But if he wished to
take a wife, let him not do so without great consideration, or he might
fall into misfortune. She refused any payment, and hurried away as
lightly as a young girl.</p>

<p>Three days before St. John's Eve, the youth set out a little before
midnight. A voice cried in his ear, "You are not going right!" and he
was about to turn back when he heard voices singing in the air, which
urged him not to throw away his good fortune, and encouraged him to
proceed. He found the church-door closed, but the stranger came from
behind the left side of the church. He told the youth he feared he might
not have come; and that the church service was held at Christmas only
once in seven years, at a time when men are all asleep. The stranger
then told the youth that there was a grave mound in a certain meadow on
which grew three junipers, and under the middle one a great treasure was
buried. In order to propitiate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span> guardians of the treasure, it was
needful to slaughter three black animals, one feathered and two hairy,
and to take care that not a drop of the sacrificial blood was lost, but
all offered to the guardians. A bit of silver was to be scraped from the
youth's buckle that the gleam of the costly silver might lead him to
that which was buried. "Then cut a stick from the juniper three spans
long, turn the point three times toward the grass where you have offered
the blood, and walk nine times round the juniper bush from west to east.
But at every round strike the grass under the bush three times with the
stick, and at every blow say 'Igrek!'<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> At the eighth round you will
perceive a subterranean jingling of money, and after the ninth round you
will see the gleam of silver. Then fall on your knees, bend your face to
the ground, and cry out nine times 'Igrek,' when the treasure will
rise." The seeker must wait patiently till the treasure has risen, and
not allow himself to be frightened by the spectres which would appear,
for they were only soulless phantoms,<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> to try the seeker's courage.
If it failed, he would return home with empty hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span> The seeker must go
to the hill on St. John's Eve, when the bonfires were burning and the
people merrymaking. A third of the treasure was to be given to the poor;
the rest belonged to the finder.</p>

<p>The stranger repeated his directions three times word for word that the
youth should not forget them, when the sexton's cock crew and the
stranger vanished suddenly.</p>

<p>Next day the youth obtained a black cock and a black dog from some
neighbours, and next night he caught a mole. On St. John's Eve he took
the three animals, and carried out his instructions at midnight,
slaughtering first the cock, then the mole, and lastly the dog, taking
care that every drop of blood should fall on the appointed spot. But
when he had called "Igrek!" at the conclusion of the ceremony, a
fiery-red cock rose suddenly under the juniper, flapped his wings,
crowed and flew away. A shovelful of silver was then cast up at the
youth's feet. Next a fiery-red cat with long golden claws rose from
under the juniper, mewed, and darted away, when the earth opened and
threw up another shovelful of silver. Next appeared a great fiery-red
dog, with a golden head and tail, who barked, and ran away, when a
shovelful of roubles was cast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span> up at the youth's feet. This was followed
by a red fox with a golden tail, a red wolf with two golden heads, and a
red bear with three golden heads; and behind each animal money was
thrown out in the grass, but behind the bear there came about a ton of
silver, and the entire heap rose to the height of a haycock. When the
bear had disappeared, there was a rushing and roaring under the juniper
as if fifty smiths were blowing the bellows at once. Then appeared from
the juniper a huge head, half man, half beast, with golden horns nine
feet long, and with golden tusks two ells long. Still more dreadful were
the flames which shot from mouth and nostrils, and which caused the
rushing and roaring. The youth was now beside himself with terror, and
rushed away, fancying himself closely pursued by the spectre, and at
last he fell down in his own farmyard and fainted. In the morning the
sunbeams roused him; and when he came to himself, he took six sacks with
him from the barn to carry off the treasure. He found the hill with the
three junipers, the slaughtered animals, and the wand; but the earth
showed no signs of having been disturbed, and the treasure had vanished.
Probably it still rests beneath the hill, waiting for a bolder man to
raise it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

marriage, as he never alluded to the subject.</p>

<h2>SECTION X</h2>

<h3><i>ORIENTAL TALES</i></h3>


<p>Under this heading I propose to notice two stories only. The first of
these is called the "Maidens who Bathed in the Moonlight" (Kreutzwald),
and is peculiarly tame and inconsequential, but yet exhibits one or two
features of special interest which forbid its being passed over
altogether.</p>

<p>A young man who had already learned the language of birds and other
mysteries, and was still desirous to peer into all sorts of secret
knowledge, applied to a famous necromancer<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> to initiate him into the
secrets hidden under the veil of night. The Finnish sorcerer endeavoured
to dissuade him from his purpose; but as he persisted, he told him that
on the evening of St. Mark's Day, which was not far off, the king of the
serpents would hold his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span> court at a place which he indicated, as was the
custom every seven years. There would be a dish of heavenly goat's-milk
before the king, and if the young man could dip a bit of bread in it,
and put it in his mouth before taking to flight, he would gain the
secret knowledge which he desired.</p>

<p>At the appointed time, the young man went at dusk to a wide moor, where
he could see nothing but a number of hillocks. At midnight a bright
light shone from one of the hillocks; it was the king's signal, and all
the other snakes, which had been lying like motionless hillocks,
uncoiled themselves, and began to move in that direction<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>. At last
they gathered themselves into a great heap as large as a haycock. The
youth at first feared to approach, but at last crept up on tiptoe, when
he saw thousands of snakes clustered round a huge serpent with a gold
crown on his head. The youth's blood froze in his veins and his hair
stood on end, but he sprang over the heap of hissing serpents, who
opened their jaws as he passed, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span> could not disengage themselves
quickly enough to strike him. He secured his prize and fled, pursued by
the hissing serpents, till he fell senseless; but at the first rays of
the sun he woke up, having left the moor four or five miles behind him,
and all danger was now over. He slept through the day, to recover
himself from the fatigue and fright, and went into the woods in the
following night, where he saw golden bathing benches arranged, with
silver bath whisks<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> and silver basins. Presently the loveliest naked
maidens assembled from all quarters, and began to wash themselves in the
bright moonlight, while the youth stood behind a bush looking on. They
were the wood-nymphs, and the daughters of the Meadow-Queen.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Towards
morning they disappeared suddenly from his sight, and though he visited
the woods again night after night, he never again saw either the bathing
utensils or the maidens, and pined away in hopeless longing.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next story is extremely interesting, and it contains a more
elaborate description of the Seal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span> of Solomon (which we should hardly
expect to be known in the legends of a country like Esthonia) than any
other which I have seen, except that given by Weil in his <i>Biblische
Legenden der Muselm&auml;nner</i>. Weil, however, represents it as a cluster of
stones, possessing different virtues, and not as a single stone. The
symbol called the Seal of Solomon by the Freemasons, &amp;c., consists of
two equilateral triangles intersecting each other within a circle, and
is regarded by mystics of every class as one of the most sacred of all
symbols. In Eastern legends the mystical name of God is said to have
been inscribed on the Seal. Arabian writers say that the embalmed body
of Solomon, with the ring on his finger, sits enthroned on one of the
islands of the Circumambient Ocean. Cf. the story "Bulookiya" (<i>Thousand
and One Nights</i>), and Kirby's poem of <i>Ed-Dimiryaht</i>.</p>

<h2>THE NORTHERN FROG<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>.</h2>

<h3>(<span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>).</h3>


<p>Once upon a time, as old people relate, there existed a horrible monster
which came from the north. It exterminated men and animals from large
districts, and if nobody had been able to arrest its progress, it might
gradually have swept all living things from the earth.</p>

<p>It had a body like an ox and legs like a frog; that is to say, two short
ones in front, and two long ones behind. Its tail was ten fathoms long.
It moved like a frog, but cleared two miles at every bound. Fortunately
it used to remain on the spot where it had once alighted for several
years, and did not advance farther till it had eaten the whole
neighbourhood bare. Its body was entirely encased in scales harder than
stone or bronze, so that nothing could injure it. Its two large eyes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
shone like the brightest tapers both by day and night, and whoever had
the misfortune to meet their glare became as one bewitched, and was
forced to throw himself into the jaws of the monster. So it happened
that men and animals offered themselves to be devoured, without any
necessity for it to move from its place. The neighbouring kings offered
magnificent rewards to any one who could destroy the monster by magic or
otherwise, and many people had tried their fortune, but their efforts
were all futile. On one occasion, a large wood in which the monster was
skulking was set on fire. The wood was destroyed, but the noxious animal
was not harmed in the slightest degree. However, it was reported among
old people that nobody could overcome the monster except with the help
of King Solomon's Seal, on which a secret inscription was engraved, from
which it could be discovered how the monster might be destroyed. But
nobody could tell where the seal was now concealed, nor where to find a
sorcerer who could read the inscription.</p>

<p>At length a young man whose head and heart were in the right place
determined to set out in search of the seal-ring, trusting in his good
fortune.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span> He started in the direction of the East, where it is supposed
that the wisdom of the ancients is to be sought for. After some years he
met with a celebrated magician of the East, and asked him for advice.
The sorcerer answered, "Men have but little wisdom, and here it can
avail you nothing, but God's birds will be your best guides under
heaven, if you will learn their language. I can help you with it if you
will stay with me for a few days."</p>

<p>The young man thankfully accepted this friendly offer, and replied, "I
am unable at present to make you any return for your kindness, but if I
should succeed in my enterprise, I will richly reward you for your
trouble." Then the sorcerer prepared a powerful charm, by boiling nine
kinds of magic herbs which he had gathered secretly by moonlight.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> He
made the young man drink a spoonful every day, and it had the effect of
making the language of birds intelligible to him. When he departed, the
sorcerer said, "If you should have the good luck to find and get
possession of Solomon's Seal, come back to me, that I may read you the
inscription on the ring, for there is no one else now living who can do
so."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>On the very next day the young man found the world quite transformed. He
no longer went anywhere alone, but found company everywhere, for he now
understood the language of birds, and thus many secrets were revealed to
him which human wisdom would have been unable to discover. Nevertheless,
some time passed before he could learn anything about the ring. At
length one evening, when he was exhausted with heat and fatigue, he lay
down under a tree in a wood to eat his supper, when he heard two strange
birds with bright coloured plumage talking about him in the branches.
One of them said, "I know the silly wanderer under the tree, who has
already wandered about so much without finding a trace of what he wants.
He is searching for the lost ring of King Solomon." The other bird
replied, "I think he must seek the help of the Hell-Maiden,<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> who
would certainly be able to help him to find it. Even if she herself does
not possess the ring, she must know well enough who owns it now." The
first bird returned, "It may be as you say, but where can he find the
Hell-Maiden, who has no fixed abode, and is here to-day and there
to-morrow? He might as well try to fetter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span> the wind." "I can't say
exactly where she is at present," said the other bird, "but in three
days' time she will come to the spring to wash her face, as is her
custom every month on the night of the full moon, so that the bloom of
youth never disappears from her cheeks, and her face never wrinkles with
age." The first bird responded, "Well, the spring is not far off; shall
we amuse ourselves by watching her proceedings?" "Willingly," said the
other.</p>

<p>The young man resolved at once to follow the birds and visit the spring;
but two difficulties troubled him. In the first place, he feared he
might be asleep when the birds set out; and secondly, he had no wings,
with which he could follow close behind them. He was too weary to lie
awake all night, for he could not keep his eyes open, but his anxiety
prevented him from sleeping quietly, and he often woke up for fear of
missing the departure of the birds. Consequently he was very glad when
he looked up in the tree at sunrise, and saw the bright-coloured birds
sitting motionless with their heads under their wings. He swallowed his
breakfast, and then waited for the birds to wake up. But they did not
seem disposed to go anywhere<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span> that morning; but fluttered about as if to
amuse themselves, in search of food, and flew from one tree-top to
another till evening, when they returned to roost at their old quarters.
On the second day it was just the same. However, on the third morning
one bird said to the other, "We must go to the spring to-day, to see the
Hell-Maiden washing her face." They waited till noon, and then flew away
direct towards the south. The young man's heart beat with fear lest he
should lose sight of his guides. But the birds did not fly farther than
he could see, and perched on the summit of a tree. The young man ran
after them till he was all in a sweat and quite out of breath. After
resting three times, the birds reached a small open glade, and perched
on a high tree at its edge. When the young man arrived, he perceived a
spring in the midst of the opening, and sat down under the tree on which
the birds were perched. Then he pricked up his ears, and listened to the
talk of the feathered creatures.</p>

<p>"The sun has not set," said one bird, "and we must wait till the moon
rises and the maiden comes to the well. We will see whether she notices
the young man under the tree." The other bird replied, "Nothing escapes
her eyes which concerns a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span> young man. Will this one be clever enough to
escape falling into her net?" "We will see what passes between them,"
returned the first bird.</p>

<p>Evening came, and the full moon had already risen high above the wood,
when the young man heard a slight rustling, and in a few moments a
maiden emerged from the trees, and sped across the grass to the spring
so lightly that her feet hardly seemed to touch the ground. The young
man perceived in an instant that she was the most beautiful woman he had
ever seen in his life, and he could not take his eyes from her.</p>

<p>She went straight to the well, without taking any heed of him, raised
her eyes to the moon, and then fell on her knees and washed her face
nine times in the spring. Every time she looked up at the moon, and
cried out, "Fair and round-cheeked, as now thou art, may my beauty
likewise endure imperishably." Then she walked nine times round the
spring, and each time she sang&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let the maiden's face not wrinkle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor her red cheeks lose their beauty;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the moon should wane and dwindle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May my beauty grow for ever,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my joy bloom on for ever!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>Then she dried her face with her long hair, and was about to depart,
when her eyes suddenly fell upon the young man who was sitting under the
tree, and she turned towards him immediately. The young man rose up to
await her approach. The fair maiden drew nearer, and said to him, "You
have exposed yourself to severe punishment for spying on the private
affairs of a maiden in the moonlight, but as you are a stranger, and
came here by accident, I will forgive you. But you must inform me truly
who you are, and how you came here, where no mortal has ever before set
foot."</p>

<p>The youth answered with much politeness, "Forgive me, fair lady, for
having offended you without my knowledge or intention. When I arrived
here, after long wanderings, I found this nice place under the tree, and
prepared to camp here for the night. Your arrival interrupted me, and I
remained sitting here, thinking that I should not disturb you if I
looked on quietly."</p>

<p>The maiden answered in the most friendly manner, "Come to our house
to-night. It is better to rest on cushions than on the cold moss."</p>

<p>The young man hesitated for a moment, uncertain whether he ought to
accept her friendly invitation or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span> to decline it. One of the birds in
the tree remarked to the other, "He would be a fool if he did not accept
her offer." Perhaps the maiden did not know the language of birds, for
she added, "Fear nothing, my friend. I have not invited you with any ill
intention, but wish you well with all my heart." The birds responded,
"Go where you are asked, but beware of giving any blood, lest you should
sell your soul."</p>

<p>Then the youth went with her. Not far from the spring they arrived at a
beautiful garden, in which stood a magnificent mansion, which shone in
the moonlight as if the roof and walls were made of gold and silver.
When the youth entered, he passed through very splendid apartments, each
grander than the last; hundreds of tapers were burning in gold
chandeliers, and everywhere diffused a light like that of day. At length
they reached a room where an elegant supper was laid out, and two chairs
stood at the table, one of silver and the other of gold. The maiden sat
down on the golden chair, and invited the youth to take the other.
White-robed damsels served up and removed the dishes, but they spoke no
word, and trod as softly as if on cats' feet. After supper the youth
remained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span> alone with the royal maiden, and they kept up a lively
conversation, till a woman in red garments appeared to remind them that
it was bedtime.</p>

<p>Then the maiden showed the young man to another room, where stood a
silken bed with cushions of down, after which she retired. He thought he
must have gone to heaven with his living body, for he never expected to
find such luxuries on earth. But he could never afterwards tell whether
it was the delusion of dreams or whether he actually heard voices round
his bed crying out words which chilled his heart&mdash;"Give no blood!"</p>

<p>Next morning the maiden asked him whether he would not like to stay
here, where the whole week was one long holiday. And as the youth did
not answer immediately, she added, "I am young and fair, as you see
yourself, and I am under no one's authority, and can do what I like.
Until now, it never entered my head to marry, but from the moment when I
saw you, other thoughts came suddenly into my mind, for you please me.
If we should both be of one mind, let us wed without delay. I possess
endless wealth and goods, as you may easily convince yourself at every
step, and thus I can live in royal state day by day. What<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>ever your
heart desires, that can I provide for you."</p>

<p>The cajoleries of the fair maid might well have turned the youth's head,
but by good fortune he remembered that the birds had called her the
Hell-Maiden, and had warned him to give her no blood, and that he had
received the same warning at night, though whether sleeping or waking he
knew not. He therefore replied, "Dear lady, do not be angry with me if I
tell you candidly that marriage should not be rushed upon at racehorse
speed, but requires longer consideration. Pray therefore allow me a few
days for reflection, until we are better acquainted." "Why not?"
answered the fair maid. "I am quite content that you should think on the
matter for a few weeks, and set your mind at rest."</p>

<p>Lest the youth might feel dull, the maiden led him from one part of the
magnificent house to another, and showed him all the rich storehouses
and treasure-chambers, thinking that it might soften his heart. All
these treasures were the result of magic, for the maiden could have
built such a palace with all its contents on any day and at any place
with the aid of Solomon's Seal. But everything was unsubstantial, for it
was woven of wind,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span> and dissolved again into the wind, without leaving a
trace behind. But the youth was not aware of this, and looked upon all
the glamour as reality.</p>

<p>One day the maiden led him into a secret chamber, where a gold casket
stood on a silver table. This she showed him, and then said, "Here is
the most precious of all my possessions, the like of which is not to be
found in the whole world. It is a costly golden ring. If you will marry
me, I will give it you for a keepsake, and it will make you the happiest
of all mankind. But in order that the bond of our love should last for
ever, you must give me three drops of blood from the little finger of
your left hand in exchange for the ring."</p>

<p>The youth turned cold when he heard her ask for blood, for he remembered
that his soul was at stake. But he was crafty enough not to let her
notice his emotion, and not to refuse her, but asked carelessly what
were the properties of the ring.</p>

<p>The maiden answered, "No one living has been able to fathom the whole
power of this ring, and no one can completely explain the secret signs
engraved upon it. But, even with the imperfect knowledge of its
properties which I possess, I can perform many wonders which no other
creature can accom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>plish. If I put the ring on the little finger of my
left hand, I can rise in the air like a bird and fly whithersoever I
will. If I place the ring on the ring-finger of my left hand, I become
invisible to all eyes, while I myself can see everything that passes
around me. If I put the ring on the middle finger of my left hand, I
become invulnerable to all weapons, and neither water nor fire can hurt
me. If I place it on the index finger of my left hand, I can create all
things which I desire with its aid; I can build houses in a moment, or
produce other objects. As long as I wear it on the thumb of my left
hand, my hand remains strong enough to break down rocks and walls.
Moreover, the ring bears other secret inscriptions which, as I said
before, no one has yet been able to explain; but it may readily be
supposed that they contain many important secrets. In ancient times, the
ring belonged to King Solomon, the wisest of kings, and in whose reign
lived the wisest of men. At the present day it is unknown whether the
ring was formed by divine power or by human hands; but it is supposed
that an angel presented the ring to the wise king."</p>

<p>When the youth heard the fair one speak in this way, he determined
immediately to endeavour to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span> possess himself of the ring by craft, and
therefore pretended that he could not believe what he had heard. He
hoped by this means to induce the maiden to take the ring out of the
casket to show him, when he might have an opportunity of possessing
himself of the talisman. But he did not venture to ask her plainly to
show him the ring. He flattered and cajoled her, but the only thought in
his mind was to get possession of the ring. Presently the maiden took
the key of the casket from her bosom as if to unlock it; but she changed
her mind, and replaced it, saying, "There's plenty of time for that
afterwards."</p>

<p>A few days later, their conversation reverted to the magic ring, and the
youth said, "In my opinion, the things which you tell me of the power of
your ring are quite incredible."</p>

<p>Then the maiden opened the casket and took out the ring, which shone
through her fingers like the brightest sun-ray. Then she placed it in
jest on the middle finger of her left hand, and told the youth to take a
knife and stab her with it wherever he liked, for it would not hurt her.
The youth protested against the proposed experiment; but, as she
insisted, he was obliged to humour her. At first he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span> began in play, and
then in earnest to try to strike the maiden with the knife; but it
seemed as if there was an invisible wall of iron between them. The blade
would not pierce it, and the maiden stood before him unhurt and smiling.
Then she moved the ring to her ring-finger, and in an instant she
vanished from the eyes of the youth, and he could not imagine what had
become of her. Presently she stood before him smiling, in the same place
as before, holding the ring between her fingers.</p>

<p>"Let me try," said he, "whether I can also do these strange things with
the ring."</p>

<p>The maiden suspected no deceit, and gave it to him.</p>

<p>The youth pretended he did not quite know what to do with it and asked,
"On which finger must I place the ring to become invulnerable to sharp
weapons?" "On the ring-finger of the left hand," said the maiden,
smiling. She then took the knife herself and tried to strike him, but
could not do him any harm. Then the youth took the knife from her and
tried to wound himself, but he found that this too was impossible. Then
he asked the maiden how he could cleave stones and rocks with the ring.
She took him to the enclosure where stood a block of granite a fathom
high. "Now<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span> place the ring," said the maiden, "on the thumb of your left
hand, and then strike the stone with your fist, and you will see the
strength of your hand." The youth did so, and to his amazement he saw
the stone shiver into a thousand pieces under the blow. Then he thought,
"He who does not seize good fortune by the horns is a fool, for when it
has once flown, it never returns." While he was still jesting about the
destruction of the stone, he played with the ring, and slipped it
suddenly on the ring-finger of his left hand. Then cried the maiden,
"You will remain invisible to me until you take off the ring again." But
this was far from the young man's thoughts. He hurried forwards a few
paces, and then moved the ring to the little finger of his left hand,
and soared into the air like a bird. When the maiden saw him flying
away, she thought at first that this experiment too was only in jest,
and cried out, "Come back, my friend. You see now that I have told you
the truth." But he who did not return was the youth, and when the maiden
realised his treachery, she broke out into bitter lamentations over her
misfortune.</p>

<p>The youth did not cease his flight till he arrived, some days later, at
the house of the famous sorcerer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span> who had taught him the language of
birds. The sorcerer was greatly delighted to find that his pupil's
journey had turned out so successfully. He set to work at once to read
the secret inscriptions on the ring, but he spent seven weeks before he
could accomplish it. He then gave the young man the following
instructions how to destroy the Northern Frog:&mdash;"You must have a great
iron horse cast, with small wheels under each foot, so that it can be
moved backwards and forwards. You must mount this, and arm yourself with
an iron spear two fathoms long, which you will only be able to wield
when you wear the magic ring on the thumb of your left hand. The spear
must be as thick as a great birch-tree in the middle, and both ends must
be sharpened to a point. You must fasten two strong chains, ten fathoms
long, to the middle of the spear, strong enough to hold the frog. As
soon as the frog has bitten hard on the spear, and it has pierced his
jaws, you must spring like the wind from the iron horse to avoid falling
into the monster's throat, and must fix the ends of the chains into the
ground with iron posts so firmly that no force can drag them out again.
In three or four days' time the strength of the frog will be so far
exhausted that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span> you can venture to approach it. Then place Solomon's
ring on the thumb of your left hand, and beat the frog to death. But
till you reach it, you must keep the ring constantly on the ring-finger
of your left hand, that the monster cannot see you, or it would strike
you dead with its long tail. But when you have accomplished all this,
take great care not to lose the ring, nor to allow anybody to deprive
you of it by a trick."</p>

<p>Our friend thanked the sorcerer for his advice, and promised to reward
him for his trouble afterwards. But the sorcerer answered, "I have
learned so much magic wisdom by deciphering the secret inscriptions on
the ring, that I need no other profit for myself." Then they parted, and
the young man hastened home, which was no longer difficult to him, as he
could fly like a bird wherever he wished.</p>

<p>He reached home in a few weeks, and heard from the people that the
horrible Northern Frog was already in the neighbourhood, and might be
expected to cross the frontier any day. The king caused it to be
proclaimed everywhere that if any one could destroy the frog, he would
not only give him part of his kingdom, but his daughter in marriage
likewise. A few days later, the young man came before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span> king, and
declared that he hoped to destroy the monster, if the king would provide
him with what was necessary; and the king joyfully consented. All the
most skilful craftsmen of the neighbourhood were called together to
construct first the iron horse, next the great spear, and lastly the
iron chains, the links of which were two inches thick. But when all was
ready, it was found that the iron horse was so heavy that a hundred men
could not move it from its place. The youth was therefore obliged to
move the horse away alone, with the help of his ring.</p>

<p>The frog was now hardly four miles away, so that a couple of bounds
might carry it across the frontier. The young man now reflected how he
could best deal with the monster alone, for, as he was obliged to push
the heavy iron horse from below, he could not mount it, as the sorcerer
had directed him. But he unexpectedly received advice from the beak of a
raven, "Mount upon the iron horse, and set the spear against the ground,
and you can then push yourself along as you would push a boat from the
shore." The young man did so, and found that he was able to proceed in
this way. The monster at once opened its jaws afar off, ready to receive
the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span> expected prey. A few fathoms more, and the man and the iron horse
were in the monster's jaws. The young man shook with horror, and his
heart froze to ice, but he kept his wits about him, and thrust with all
his might, so that the iron spear which he held upright in his hand,
pierced the jaws of the monster. Then he leaped from the iron horse, and
sprang away like lightning as the monster clashed his jaws together. A
hideous roar, which was heard for many miles, announced that the
Northern Frog had bitten the spear fast. When the youth turned round, he
saw one point of the spear projecting a foot above the upper jaw, and
concluded that the other was firmly fixed in the lower one; but the frog
had crushed the iron horse between his teeth. The young man now hastened
to fasten the chains in the ground, for which strong iron posts several
fathoms long had been prepared.</p>

<p>The death-struggles of the monster lasted for three days and three
nights, and when it reared itself, it struck the ground so violently
with its tail, that the earth was shaken for fifty miles round. At
length, when it was too weak to move its tail any longer, the young man
lifted a stone with the help of his ring, which twenty men could not
have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span> moved, and beat the monster about the head with it until no
further sign of life was visible.</p>

<p>Immeasurable was the rejoicing when the news arrived that the terrible
monster was actually dead. The victor was brought to the capital with
all possible respect, as if he had been a powerful king. The old king
did not need to force his daughter to the marriage, for she herself
desired to marry the strong man who had alone successfully accomplished
what others had not been able to effect with the aid of a whole army.
After some days, a magnificent wedding was prepared. The festivities
lasted a whole month, and all the kings of the neighbouring countries
assembled to thank the man who had rid the world of its worst enemy. But
amid the marriage festival and the general rejoicings it was forgotten
that the monster's carcass had been left unburied, and as it was now
decaying, it occasioned such a stench that no one could approach it.
This gave rise to diseases of which many people died. Then the king's
son-in-law determined to seek help from the sorcerer of the East. This
did not seem difficult to him with the aid of his ring, with which he
could fly in the air like a bird.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>But the proverb says that injustice never prospers, and that as we sow
we reap. The king's son-in-law was doomed to realise the truth of this
adage with his stolen ring. The Hell-Maiden left no stone unturned,
night or day, to discover the whereabouts of her lost ring. When she
learned through her magic arts that the king's son-in-law had set out in
the form of a bird to visit the sorcerer, she changed herself into an
eagle, and circled about in the air till the bird for which she was
waiting came in sight. She recognised him at once by the ring, which he
carried on a riband round his neck. Then the eagle swooped upon the
bird, and at the moment that she seized him in her claws she tore the
ring from his neck with her beak, before he could do anything to prevent
her. Then the eagle descended to the earth with her prey, and they both
stood together in their former human shapes. "Now you have fallen into
my hands, you rascal," cried the Hell-Maiden. "I accepted you as my
lover, and you practised deceit and theft against me: is that my reward?
You robbed me of my most precious jewel by fraud, and you hoped to pass
a happy life as the king's son-in-law; but now we have turned over a
new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span> leaf. You are in my power, and you shall atone to me for all your
villainy." "Forgive me, forgive me," said the king's son-in-law. "I know
well that I have treated you very badly, but I heartily repent of my
fault." But the maiden answered, "Your pleadings and your repentance
come too late, and nothing can help you more. I dare not overlook your
offence, for that would bring me disgrace, and make me a byword among
the people. Twice have you sinned against me: for, firstly, you have
despised my love; and, secondly, you have stolen my ring; and now you
must suffer your punishment." As she spoke, she placed the ring on the
thumb of her left hand, took the man on her arm like a doll, and carried
him away. This time she did not take him to a magnificent palace, but to
a cavern in the rocks where chains were hanging on the walls. The maiden
grasped the ends of the chains and fettered the man hand and foot, so
that it was impossible for him to escape, and she said in anger, "Here
shall you remain a prisoner till your end. I will send you so much food
every day, that you shall not die of hunger, but you need never expect
to escape." Then she left him.</p>

<p>The king and his daughter endured a time of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span> terrible anxiety as weeks
and weeks passed by, and the traveller neither returned nor sent any
tidings. The king's daughter often dreamed that her consort was in great
distress, and therefore she begged her father to assemble the sorcerers
from all parts, in hopes that they might perhaps be able to give some
information respecting what had happened to him, and how he could be
rescued. All the sorcerers could say was that he was still alive, but in
great distress, and they could neither discover where he was, nor how he
could be found. At length a famous sorcerer from Finland was brought to
the king, who was able to inform him that his son-in-law was kept in
captivity in the East, not by a human being, but by a more powerful
creature. Then the king sent messengers to the East to seek for his lost
son-in-law. Fortunately they met with the old sorcerer who had read the
inscriptions on Solomon's Seal, and had thus learned wisdom which was
hidden from all others. The sorcerer soon discovered what he wished to
know, and said, "The man is kept prisoner by magic art in such and such
a place, but you cannot release him without my help, so I must go with
you myself."</p>

<p>They set out accordingly, and in a few days, led<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span> by the birds, they
reached the cavern in the rock where the king's son-in-law had already
languished for seven years in captivity. He recognised the sorcerer
immediately, but the latter did not know him, he was so much worn and
wasted. The sorcerer loosed his chains by his magic art, took him home,
and nursed and tended him till he had recovered sufficient strength to
set out on his journey. He reached his destination on the very day that
the old king died, and was chosen king. Then came days of joy after long
days of suffering; and he lived happily till his end, but he never
recovered the magic ring, nor has it ever since been seen by human eyes.</p>

from Jannsen's collections, of many of which I have given only a brief
outline.</p>

<h2>SECTION XI</h2>

<h3><i>CHURCH-STORIES</i></h3>


<p>Several of these, given by Jannsen, may be briefly narrated.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE CHURCH AT REVEL.</h2>


<p>Revel was formerly an unimportant place, and the inhabitants wished to
make it famous by building a church. They contracted with the great
architect Olaf<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> to erect it; and when it was completed, and he was
about to fix the cross on the summit, his wife cried out joyfully, "Olaf
will come home to-day with a thousand barrels of gold."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> But scarcely
had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span> Olaf fixed the cross in its place, when he slipped and fell to the
ground, and a toad and a snake sprang out of his mouth. The Devil wished
to destroy the church, but could not get near it; so he made a sling at
Pernau, and hurled a great rock at it. But the sling broke, and the rock
fell half-way between Pernau and Revel, where it now remains. (Similar
tales are related of the Devil in many countries, but are perhaps
commonest in Scandinavia.)</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE CHURCH AT P&Uuml;HALEPP.</h2>


<p>Before Christian times there was a great alder forest in the island of
Dag&ouml;, where the people used to make sacrifices and hold festivals.
Afterwards the forest was hewn down, all but one tree, under which the
people wished to build a church. But the missionaries would not consent,
till a man advised them to yoke two oxen to the cart in which the
building materials should be loaded, and then let them wander at will.
Where they halted, the church should be built.</p>

<p>So the oxen were driven to the alder forest, where there was plenty of
grass, and after being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span> allowed to graze awhile they were brought back
and yoked to the cart. They returned to the heath and began to feed, and
the church was erected on that spot and named the Church of P&uuml;halepp.</p>

<p>The Devil thought to destroy it by hurling two great rocks at it at
night from a hill, after having carefully noted its position in the
daytime. He missed his aim in the darkness, but mounted his mare and
rode to see what damage was done. Just as he reached the church the cock
crew, and he was forced to turn round and ride back to hell. But the
marks of the mare's hoofs are still to be seen where he heard the cock
crow.</p>

<p>Another story relates how the Devil pulled down a church which was in
course of erection, and tore up the very foundations. But a wise man
told the people to take two white calves, dropped on that night, harness
them to a cart, and build the church where they stopped, which was
accordingly done.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY CROSS.</h2>


<p>A blind nobleman of Vastemois, near Fellin, was driving out one day,
when his coachman saw a splendid golden cross. His master ordered him to
drive up to it; and on touching it, he recovered his sight. In
gratitude, he built a church on the spot, which was afterwards destroyed
in war-time, and only the walls left standing. The people were too poor
to rebuild it, but from the ruins grew a tree which all regarded as
holy. The then over-lord commanded them to fell it, and as they refused,
he did so himself, but was immediately struck blind.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE CHURCH AT FELLIN.</h2>


<p>In former days, the church of Fellin did not stand where it stands at
present, but close to the lake. It was prophesied that it should stand
till seven brothers should be present in it together. When this happened
by chance, the church began to sink. The congregation escaped, except
the seven brothers,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span> who remained in it, but it sunk till even the
summit of the spire had disappeared. The site is now a marshy meadow,
but if any one is there near midnight on New Year's Eve, he hears
entrancing voices, and cannot move from the spot till the church clock
beneath the ground has struck the last stroke of twelve.</p>

<h2>SECTION XII</h2>

<h3><i>UNNATURAL BROTHERS</i></h3>


<p>The story of the wicked rich brother who oppresses the poor one is not
unknown in Esthonia. There is a hideous story of such a pair, relating
how when the poor brother died his widow begged grave-clothing from the
wife of the rich one. When the rich brother returned, he scolded his
wife, and rushed off, cursing and swearing, to strip the body of his
dead brother, even in his coffin, crying, "That's mine! that's mine!"
But when he would have laid the naked corpse back in the coffin, it
clung round his neck, and he was compelled to carry it about with him
for the rest of his life.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE RICH BROTHER AND THE POOR ONE.</h2>


<p>Once upon a time there were two brothers, one of whom had abundance, but
the other was very poor.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span> As is the way of the world, riches do not heed
poverty, and thus it was with the two brothers. The rich one would not
give the poor one even a spoonful of soup.</p>

<p>One day the rich brother gave a great feast. The poor brother expected
to have been invited, but his hopes were vain.</p>

<p>All at once a bright idea struck him, and he went to the river and
caught three large pike. "I'll carry these to my brother," said he, "and
perhaps they will bring me a blessing."</p>

<p>He took the fish to his brother, and addressed him humbly, like a rich
lord. But it made no difference. His brother only said, "Many thanks,"
turned his back, and went off.</p>

<p>What could the poor brother do? He also turned round, and went his way,
sorrowfully reflecting, "He is my brother in name indeed, but he's worse
than an entire stranger!"</p>

<p>All at once he saw an old man sitting by the road, who rose up quickly
and went towards him, saying, "Friend, why do you look so sorrowfully on
the world?"</p>

<p>"Sorrowful or not," said the poor brother, "it goes well enough with me!
I brought my rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span> brother three fish for a present, and he didn't even
give me a drink in return!"</p>

<p>"But you perhaps got something else?" asked the old man.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, 'many thanks,'" said he; "that's your something else!"</p>

<p>The old man answered, "Give me your 'many thanks,' and you shall become
a rich man."</p>

<p>"Take it, and welcome," said the poor brother.</p>

<p>Then the old man instructed him as follows:&mdash;"Go home, look for Poverty
under the stove, and throw it into the river, and you shall see how it
will fare with you."</p>

<p>Then he went his way, and the poor brother returned home. He found
Poverty under the stove, seized it, and flung it into the river.</p>

<p>After this, everything which he undertook succeeded with the poor
brother, and it was a real marvel to see how he got on. His fields grew
fine harvests, and his barns and stables were soon more imposing than
his rich brother's.</p>

<p>When the rich brother saw it, he grew envious, and wanted to know how
the other had got wealthy. He was always teasing him to know how it was,
and at last the other got tired of it, and said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span> "How did I get rich? I
dragged Poverty out from under the stove, and threw it in the water.
That's how it was!"</p>

<p>"That's how it was," cried the rich brother. "Wait a bit! your sort
shan't outdo me!"</p>

<p>So he went to the river and fished for Poverty, from whom he supposed
that his poor brother had received everything. He fished and fished, and
would do nothing else, till at length he held Poverty fast.</p>

<p>While he inspected and examined it at home, it slipped through his
fingers and hid under his stove, and nobody could get it out again.</p>

<p>After this everything went worse and worse with the rich brother, till
he became at last quite poor, and remained so.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>This story, which I have not abridged, is a well-known Sclavonic legend.
It is probably connected with the story of the three apes which forms
the introduction to that of "Khaleefeh the Fisherman," in the <i>Thousand
and One Nights</i>.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>
<h2>SECTION XIII</h2>

<h3><i>PLAGUE-LEGENDS</i></h3>


<p>The plague continued to rage in Eastern Europe long after it had
disappeared from the West, and down to a very recent period.
Consequently we find plague-legends, which have almost died out in the
British Islands, except in Scotland, rife among all the Eastern nations.
The Plague-demon is usually represented as female, but in the Esthonian
legends it is masculine.</p>

<p>The Plague once seated himself in a boat which was returning to the
Island of Rog&ouml;,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> which had hitherto escaped his ravages, in the shape
of a tall black man with a great scythe in his hand. He arrived among
the dead crew, and at once sprang on shore and began to destroy the
inhabitants. Some saw the Plague himself, and others not. If any one saw
him, his heart froze with terror<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span> before he could speak a word.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> One
night during a violent storm, an old woman saw him enter her cottage as
she was sitting alone spinning; but she gathered courage to cry out,
"Welcome, in God's name." He stopped short, muttering, "That's enough,"
returned to the boat in which he had come, and went out to sea. The
storm ceased as he departed, and since then he has never reappeared.</p>

<p>In the Island of Nuck&ouml; he appeared as an old grey man, with a taper in
one hand and a staff in the other, a book under his arm, and a
three-cornered hat on his head. As he went from house to house, he
looked up the names of his victims in his book, let his taper shine on
their faces to make sure that he had made no mistake, and touched the
doomed with his staff. A peasant once saw him enter his cottage, and
touch all with his staff, except himself and the infant in the cradle.
All the others died before cockcrow.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>Another time the Plague was driving down a steep path which led to a
village, when he upset his vehicle and broke the axle. A passing peasant
helped him to bind it up, and directed him to the smithy; but he
declared that he was the Plague, and for the good deed that had been
done him all the village should be spared. So he turned his horse, drove
back up the hill, and vanished like a cloud. When the news was brought
to the village, bonfires of rejoicing were lighted, and kept up for many
days.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span></p>
<h2>SECTION XIV</h2>

<h3><i>BEAST-STORIES</i></h3>


<p>I commence with wolf-stories, which are rather numerous in Esthonia. One
of them relates the creation of the wolf. When God had created the
world, he asked the Devil what he thought of his work; and the Devil
objected that there was no animal to scare away mischievous boys from
the woods when the bear and the snake were sunk in their winter sleep.
Thereupon God gave leave to the Devil to make such an animal as he
wished, and to give it life by the formula, "Stand up and devour the
Devil." Then the Devil made the wolf's back of a strong hedge-pole, the
head of a tree-stump, the breast of twigs and leather, and the loins of
bricks.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> He made the tail of a fern-frond, and the feet of
alder-stumps, but he put a stone into its breast for the heart. He
clothed the body with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span> moss, burning coals formed the eyes, and iron
nails were used for the teeth and claws. He then named the creature
Wolf, and pronounced the spell as far as "devour," when the creature
raised his head and snorted. The Devil was too much frightened to
finish, but afterwards plucked up courage, and repeated the spell,
substituting God's name for his own. But the wolf took no notice, and
when the Devil appealed to God, he was only told to use the same spell;
so he stood a long way off and pronounced it. Then the wolf rushed at
the Devil, who was forced to hide under a stone to save himself. Since
then the wolf has been the Devil's worst enemy, and pursues him
everywhere.</p>

<p>Another story relates how God forbade the wolf to eat the flocks and the
dogs, but to receive his share when the farmers baked. But one day a
farmer's wife threw the wolf a red-hot stone instead of bread, and he
burnt his muzzle, which has been black ever since. Since then he devours
whatever falls in his way.</p>

<p>A farmer, hemmed in by a herd of wolves, succeeded in driving them away,
but was followed home by one of them. When he took his provisions out of
the sledge, he laid his hand on a square object like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span> whetstone. He
then remembered hearing that the wolves sometimes receive food from
heaven, and thought this might be their portion. So he flung it to the
wolf, saying, "Take it if it's yours;" and the wolf seized it and
disappeared.</p>

<p>There is an odd story of a young woman who was carrying an apron full of
eggs to her mother. She was overtaken by a violent thunderstorm, and
sheltered under a fir-tree. She felt something moving among the eggs,
and was frightened; but presently she was still more terrified when she
found a great wolf tugging at her apron. She dropped it in her fright,
and a black cat jumped out and darted away, pursued by the wolf. When
she reached the village, her mother told her that the black cat was the
Devil, who had taken that form in order to play her a trick or do her
some injury, but had been scared away by the wolf.</p>

<p>Have we here an inverted and distorted echo of "Little Red Riding Hood?"</p>

<p>A peasant who was broiling fish in the forest at nightfall met with a
still more alarming adventure. A black man appeared to him, and
commanded him to fetch him a spit, for he wanted to broil fish too. But
the spit which he wanted was a long sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span> stake, and the peasant
himself was to be the fish. In his terror the peasant called "St.
George's Dogs" to his aid, and a pack of wolves rushed out, and chased
the Devil away, while the peasant drew out the axle from his cart-wheel,
and supplied its place with a pole of rowan-wood.</p>

<p>Another story relates how an unfortunate wolf missed getting his usual
rations from God, and set out to forage for himself. After sparing some
whom he met, and allowing others to escape, he fell into the hands of a
young peasant, who gave him a sound beating and then took refuge in a
tree. The wolf's relatives, seeking revenge, climbed on each other's
back till they nearly reached the peasant, who upset them by a
stratagem, and they fell, many breaking their limbs. Since then a wolf
always runs away when he sees a man.</p>

<p>Were-wolves are sometimes alluded to in Esthonian tales.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The following stories are of a more miscellaneous character, and some of
them are sufficiently interesting to be given with little or no
abridgment.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>
<h2>THE MAN WITH THE BAST SHOES.</h2>


<p>Once upon a time a traveller came to a village and asked for a night's
lodging. He was handsomely dressed, but he had coarse bast shoes on his
feet. A friendly farmer received the stranger hospitably, and offered
him accommodation. At night the man asked his host, "Farmer, where shall
I put my bast shoes?" The farmer showed him the place, but he added,
"No, my shoes must spend the night among the feathered people, for that
is what they are used to. So I would rather hang them on the perch in
the hen-house." The farmer laughed at the joke, and permitted him to do
so.</p>

<p>As soon as all were in their first sleep, the owner of the bast shoes
rose from his bed, slipped into the hen-house, tore the shoes to pieces,
and scattered the coarse plaits among the fowls. Next morning he went to
the master of the house and complained, "Farmer, my property was badly
damaged last night." Said the farmer, "Well, let whoever has done the
mischief make it good." This was just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span> what the stranger wanted, and he
immediately caught the dappled cock, and put him into his knapsack,
"for," said he, "he's the culprit; last night he pecked at my shoes till
he spoiled them." Then he proceeded on his journey with the cock.</p>

<p>On the evening of the same day he arrived at a neighbouring village, and
asked again for accommodation. At night he put the cock in the farmer's
sheep-pen, and excused himself by saying, "My cock has not been used to
anything else since he was a chicken." But at night he strangled the
bird, and then complained, "The sheep have killed my cock." He
indemnified himself by taking a fat ram from the flock, for he held by
the farmer's adage, "He who has done the mischief must pay for it."</p>

<p>By a similar stratagem he exchanged the ram at the third village for an
ox, and at last the ox for a horse. He soon contrived to get a sledge
too, and drove merrily over hill and dale, till the stones flew behind
him, while he contrived new schemes and stratagems. On the way, he
encountered Master Reynard, who persuaded him by entreaties and
cajoleries to take him into his sledge. After a while, the wolf and bear
joined them, and likewise found a place in the sledge; but this made the
load<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span> too heavy, and when they came to a curve in the road, the
side-poles of the sledge gave way. Then the man sent his companions to
fetch wood to make a new pole. But none of the three brought a proper
one back. The fox and wolf brought thin sticks in their mouths, and the
bear brought a whole pine-tree, roots and all. Then the man went
himself, and soon found the wood which he wanted. Meantime, the wild
beasts availed themselves of the opportunity, and sprang upon the horse
and devoured it. But they stuffed the skin nicely with straw, and set it
carefully up, so that it stood again on its four legs as if it was
alive.</p>

<p>When the man came back with the pole, he mended the sledge and harnessed
the horse again. "Oho! now we'll drive on." But alas! the horse would
not move. Then the man looked at the red scamp, the grey rascal, and the
brown villain, and said angrily, "Give me my horse back." But the wild
beasts answered, "You killed it yourself, while we were running about
looking for wood by your orders."</p>

<p>Thus they stood quarrelling and disputing, till Reynard considered how
he could best put an end to the dispute and save his own skin. He knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
of a pit in the neighbourhood which the hunter had dug for a wolf-trap,
and covered loosely with thin twigs. "The matter won't be settled by
quarrelsome and angry words," cried he; "but come, let the four of us go
to the wolf-pit; we will all tread on it at once, and whoever falls in
shall be adjudged guilty." The rest agreed, and when they stood on the
twigs, they broke under their weight, and precipitated them into the
pit, and even Reynard was unable to escape. He had trusted too much to
the lightness of his tread, and had trodden on the twigs without
consideration. Now they were all in the trap together, and none of them
could hope to escape. The time seemed long to them, and their hunger
soon became too great to bear.</p>

<p>First of all, the wild beasts attacked the man of the bast shoes and
devoured him, and then Reynard had to resign his life. Last of all the
bear throttled the wolf. Then came the hunter and gave the bear his
quietus. Thus all the four rascals experienced the truth of the proverb,
"As the deed, so the reward."</p>

<h2>WHY THE DOG AND CAT AND THE CAT AND MOUSE ARE ENEMIES.</h2>


<p>In former days all animals dwelt together in peace; but then it befell
that the dogs killed and devoured hares and other game in the open
fields. The other animals complained, and when God called the dogs to
account, they objected that they had nothing to eat. Their plea was
admitted, and leave was granted them to eat fallen animals. The dogs
requested and received a written license to that effect, which was
intrusted to the sheep-dog, as the largest and most reliable among them.
But in autumn the sheep-dog was very busy, and could neither carry it
about with him nor find a dry place for it, so he intrusted it to the
care of his friend the tom-cat, who had always a safe room, or sat on
the stove. The cat arched his back, and rubbed it against his friend's
foot, as a promise of fidelity, and the document was laid on the stove,
where it was supposed to be safe.</p>

<p>One day the dogs found a pony in the wood which had fallen, so they fell
upon it, and killed and devoured it. The animals complained again,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span> and
the dogs were pronounced guilty; but they appealed to the license, in
which it was not stated whether the fallen animals should be dead or
alive. When the sheep-dog and the cat sought for the document, they
could not find it, for the mice had nibbled it away.</p>

<p>The cats were so angry with the mice that they began to kill and eat
them, and have done so ever since; but the dogs likewise became enemies
of the cats, as they are at present.</p>

<p>The sheep-dog did not venture to return to his fellows without the
license. They waited for him in vain, and at last followed him, and
sought for him everywhere, but could not find him. So whenever a dog
sees another he runs to ask him whether he has not got the missing
document with him.</p>

<h2>THE ORIGIN OF THE SWALLOW.</h2>


<p>The wife of a drunkard was sitting weaving with her child on her lap.
She wore a black cloth on her head, a red neckerchief, a white shift,
and a coal-black petticoat. When her husband came home, he pushed his
wife away, and destroyed the loom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span> with an axe. Then he killed the child
with a blow of his fist, and beat his wife till she fell senseless. But
Ukko took pity on her, and changed her into a swallow. As she was trying
to escape, the man struck at her with a knife, but only cleft her tail.
Since that time she flies about twittering her misfortunes, and does not
shun men like other birds, but builds her nest against their houses.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE SPIDER AND THE HORNET.</h2>


<p>Once upon a time some boys burned a hornet's nest because the hornet
stung them so badly. Then the hornet went to God to complain that the
boys despised His gifts, and scattered broken victuals about in the
fields. But God objected that she had no witnesses. So she went to the
king of the spiders, and made him return with her to God, who asked if
he had seen the boys scatter food about the fields. But the spider said
that it was not their fault, for they had no table to put their bread
on. Then God praised the spider for speaking the truth, and condemned
the hornet for telling lies and hating her neighbours without a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> cause.
He then struck her on the back with his staff, and cast her down from
heaven to earth, so that she broke in two with the fall. But he let the
spider down with a cord, because he had spoken the truth. Since then the
spider has had a net and a web, by which he can climb up and down as he
likes, as on a cord; but the hornet still retains the pinched-in body
which she got when falling from heaven, but is fat enough at both ends.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>THE OFFICIOUS FLIES.</h2>


<p>A few dozen flies once attacked a cart-horse who was feeding quietly in
a thicket, and lamented that they were not more numerous, that they
might make him lie down. Presently his skin began to itch, when he lay
down, rolled first on once side and then on the other, and crushed them
all.</p>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHY</h2>


<p>The present list contains only books and papers which have been used or
specially consulted in the preparation of this work, or which have been
published in England on Esthonian tales and poems. Other books quoted
are referred to in the Index and Glossary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Blumberg, G.</span> <i>Quellen und Realien des Kalewipoeg, nebst Varianten und
Erg&auml;nzungen</i>. Dorpat, 1869. An important work, including a map, from
which we have borrowed some particulars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Boecler, J.M.</span> <i>Der Ehsten abergl&auml;ubische Gebr&auml;uche, Weisen, und
Gewohnheiten, von Johann Wolfgang Boecler, weiland Pastor zu Kusal in
Ehstland und des Consistorii in Reval Assessor. Mit auf die Gegenwart
bez&uuml;glichen Anmerkungen beleuchtet von Dr. F. R. Kreutzwald</i>. St.
Petersburg, 1854.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bouquet</span> <i>from the Baltic</i>. <i>All the Year Round</i>, IV. pp. 80-83 (Nov. 3,
1860). Relates to some of the legends of Vanemuine, the <i>Kalevipoeg</i>,
and Koit and Aemmerik.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dido, A.</span> <i>Litt&eacute;rature orale des Estoniens</i>. <i>Bibliographie des
principale Publications de l'Estonie, et en particulier celle du Dr.
Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Reinhold Kreutzwald</i>, 1804-1882. <i>Revue des Traditions
Populaires</i>, VIII. pp. 353-365, 424-428, 485-495 (1893). Contains an
ac<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>count, more or less detailed, of the longer tales in Kreutzwald's
collection, a few being fully translated.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dido, A.</span> <i>Kalewipoeg, &Eacute;pop&eacute;e nationale Estonienne</i>. Op. cit. IX. pp.
137-155 (1894). Contains an analysis of the poem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Donner, A.</span> <i>Kalevipoeg jumalaistarulliselta ja historialliselta kannalta
katsottuna</i>. <i>Suomi</i>, ser. 2, vol. 5 (1866). Discusses the mythological
and historical character of the <i>Kalevipoeg</i>, and its relations to the
<i>Kalevala</i>, especially as regards the episode of Kullervo.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Esthonia</span>. <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia Britannica</i> (ed. IX.), vol. viii. pp. 561-563
(1878).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gould, S.B.</span> <i>The Kalevipoeg</i>. <i>Fraser's Magazine</i>, vol. 78, pp. 534-544
(Oct. 1868). A fragmentary account of the poem, containing some curious
errors, such as "Sarwik" being translated "Hell;" but with useful
comments, especially on the Kalevide's voyage to the North Pole. We
cannot see, however, that the Esthonian writings exhibit the melancholy
character of a depressed nation, as Mr. Baring-Gould imagines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grosse, Julius</span>. <i>Die Abenteuer des Kalewiden: Esthnisches Volksm&auml;rchen</i>.
Leipzig, 1875. An abstract of the story in hexameters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Israel, C. Chr.</span> <i>Kalewipoeg, oder die Abenteuer des Kalewiden, Eine
estnische Sage frei nach dem Estnischen bearbeitet</i>. Frankfort-on-Main,
1873. A good prose abstract of the poem, somewhat rearranged.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jannsen, Harry</span>. <i>M&auml;rchen und Sagen des estnischen Volkes</i>. Two Parts.
Dorpat, 1881, and Riga, 1888. A selection of tales from various sources,
some few being from Kreutzwald's collection. Valuable notes are appended
to Part ii.</p>

<p>----. <i>Esthnische M&auml;rchen</i>. <i>Veckenstedt's Zeitschrift f&uuml;r Volkskunde</i>,
i. pp. 314-317 (1889). Contains three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span> stories: "The Devil's Visit,"
"The Talking Trees" (Christian variant), and "The Officious Flies."
Jannsen states that the first has already been printed in the original,
and that the other two are from his own collections.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kalewipoeg</span>, <i>&Uuml;ks ennemuistene Eesti jut</i>. Kuopio, 1862. An earlier
edition was published at Dorpat with the German translation; but this is
the one which I have consulted in the preparation of this work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kalewipoeg</span>, <i>eine estnische Sage, zusammengestellt von F.R. Kreutzwald,
verdeutscht von C. Reinthal und Dr. Bertram</i>. Dorpat, 1857-61.</p>

special reference to the work of Pastor Jacob Hurt</i>. <i>Papers and
Transactions of International Folk-lore Congress</i>, 1892, pp. 427-429.
Based on information published by, or received from, Prof. Kaarle Krohn
of Helsingfors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kreutzwald, F.R.</span> <i>Eestirahwa ennemuisted jutud. Rahwa suust korjanud ja
&uuml;leskirjutanud</i>. Helsingfors, 1866. One of the first and best
collections of Esthonian tales, but without notes. I believe that
several later editions have been published at Dorpat.</p>

<p>---- <i>Ehstnische M&auml;rchen, aufgezeichnet von Friedrich Kreutzwald</i>. <i>Aus
dem Ehstnischen &uuml;bersetzt von F. L&ouml;we, ehem. Bibliothekar a. d. Petersb.
Akad. d. Wissenschaften</i>. <i>Nebst einem Vorwort von Anton Schiefner, und
Anmerkungen von Reinhold K&ouml;hler und Anton Schiefner</i>. Halle, 1869.
Includes a very close translation of most of the longer tales in
Kreutzwald's collection. The notes, too, are valuable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kreutzwald</span>, Fr., und <span class="smcap">Neus, H.</span> <i>Mythische und Magische Lieder der
Ehsten</i>. St. Petersburg, 1854. In Esthonian and German.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Popular Poetry</span> <i>of the Esthonians</i>. Varieties of Literature from Foreign
Literary Journals and Original MSS., now first published. London, 1795,
pp. 22-44 (reprinted in "Folk-Lore Journal," iii. pp. 156-169, 1885).
Contains twelve specimens of lyric poetry, undoubtedly based on some
German publication. The anonymous compiler makes the strange mistake of
regarding the Esthonians as "Sclavonians."</p>

<li>Kalevala, name chosen by L&ouml;nnrot for the great Finnish Epic, first
issued by the Finnish Literary Society in thirty-two Runos or
Cantos in 1835, and subsequently enlarged and recast, and published
in 1849 in fifty Runos, since when it has been reprinted
several times, the best edition of the text being that issued by
the above-mentioned Society in 1887. More or less complete
translations have appeared in English, French, German,
Swedish, Magyar, and Russian, besides specimens in Danish
and Italian. Of these versions, the most elegant appear to me
to be the abridged Swedish translations of Herzberg, in prose
and verse. The recent German translation of Paul is most
esteemed in Finland; though it was that of Schiefner, published
in 1852, which inspired Longfellow to write his "Hiawatha."
The "Kalevala" commences with creation-myths, and the birth
of the patriarch-minstrel and culture-hero V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen; proceeds
with V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen's unsuccessful wooing of the Lapp girl
Aino; and the rest of the poem is mainly occupied with the
negotiations and wars of the three heroes, V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen,
Ilmarinen, and Lemminkainen, with Louhi, the witch-queen of
Lapland. The adventures of Kullervo, the morose and wicked
slave, who corresponds to the Kalevipoeg in so many particulars,
that he was certainly originally the same character,
form a long episode, extending from Runos 31-35 inclusive.
The last Runo contains a strange confused story of the Nativity,
and ends with the consequent departure of V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen from
Finland. Many episodes and parallels of the "Kalevala"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>

to the story of the "Peacock and Peahen," &amp;c. (<i>Thousand and One
Nights</i>, notes to Chap. ix. of Lane's translation):&mdash;"The last animal
that entered with Noah into the ark was the ass, and Iblees (whom God
curse!) clung to his tail. The ass had just entered the ark, and began
to be agitated, and could not enter further into the ark, whereupon Noah
said to him, 'Enter, woe to thee!' But the ass was still agitated, and
was unable to advance. So Noah said, 'Enter, though the Devil be with
thee!' And the ass entered, and Iblees (whom God curse!) entered with
him. And Noah said, 'O enemy of God, who introduced thee into the ark?'
He answered, 'Thou; thou saidst unto the ass, "Enter, though the Devil
be with thee."' So it is said that this is the reason why the ass when
he seeth the Devil brayeth."</p></div>

are under the protection of Jutta, and there is no place in the country
where birds congregate to such an extent, and birds of passage remain so
long. Jutta is perhaps the same as Lindu (vol. ii. p. <a href='#Page_147'>147</a>). Near
Heidelberg is a spring called the "Wolfsbrunnen," where a beautiful
enchantress named Jutta, the priestess of Hertha, is said to have had an
assignation with her lover; but he found she had been killed by a wolf,
the messenger of the offended goddess. Whether there is any connection
between the German and Esthonian Jutta I do not know.</p></div>

inhabiting the undrained swamps. Monsters as terrible as those described
in "Beowulf" are popularly believed to have haunted the English fens
almost to the present day. Aino, in the <i>Kalevala</i> (Runo 4), was lured
into a lake by the sight of some maidens bathing; and it is said that it
is unsafe for sensitive people to venture near the banks of some of the
Irish lakes in the evening, lest they should be lured into the water by
the singing of the water-nymphs. In this connection, we may refer to the
oft-quoted passage from the notes to Heywood's <i>Hierarchies of the
Blessed Angels</i> (1635): "In Finland there is a castle, which is called
the New Rock, moated about with a river of unsounded depth, the water
black, and the fish therein very distasteful to the palate. In this are
spectres often seen, which foreshow either the death of the Governor, or
of some prime officer belonging to the place; and most often it
appeareth in the shape of a harper, sweetly singing and dallying and
playing under the water."&mdash;See Southey's <i>Donica</i>.</p></div>

that employed in the present story. This is interesting as showing Pikne
to be only a subordinate deity. L&ouml;we considers the Thunderer's musical
instrument to be a bagpipe.</p></div>

appears as a demigod. In the <i>Kalevala</i> he plays a part second only to
that of V&auml;in&auml;m&ouml;inen himself, but fails in many of his undertakings; for
though he is said to have forged the sky, he cannot confer speech or
warmth on the bride of gold and silver whom he forges for himself after
his first wife has been given to the wolves and bears by Kullervo; and
when he forges a new sun and moon, after the old ones have been stolen
by Louhi, they turn out miserable failures.</p></div>
